		It took Astero several weeks before he could get used to the Elessai clan. The people there were friendly and
		welcoming, perhaps a bit too much. Respected individuals were artists, writers, inventors, and scientists.
		Conversations were mostly about new inventions and the latest artwork. People discussed philosophy, chasing
		meaning in the changing world. When it came to those things, Astero often felt quite unintelligent.



		Astero's father was a skilled warrior, but above all, he was an inventor for weapons of war. He sought to find
		ways to win battles without much effort. His study was full of sketches and trinkets. The Elessai valued
		innovation, and Kairo Elessai was the best of the best.



		His father would seek his help sometimes, asking him to help build something or assist with the mathematics.
		Astero learned quite a bit from his lessons, but he was no genius.



		Everyone knew he was not related by blood to Kairo Elessai. The two looked nothing alike, and in addition,
		Astero had none of his father's capabilities. Word spread around the clan. People wondered if Astero could lead
		the Elessai one day. Most believed he would lead them to ruin.



		And still, he tried. He would study hard and assist his father whenever he could. Astero found comfort in
		reading and writing poetry, and he gained some respect in that aspect, as the public seemed to like his work,
		although he suspected they only pretended to due to his status. The people of the Elessai clan, Astero noticed,
		were hesitant to quarrel with one another. They valued creativity and accepted all ideas. And Astero, with his
		lack of imagination, felt he did not belong.



		However, it only took him a day in the Fen clan before it started to feel like home.



		Relations between the Elessai and the Fen grew stable to the point where he and his mother could visit. She had
		been wanting to show him her old home for years, and finally, Astero's father and Raigo Fen reached a diplomatic
		agreement, allowing his mother to return for just a few weeks, bringing him along.



		"You'll love it there," assured his mother as they traveled by carriage across the north eastern plains, past
		bridges built across the pieces of land. Throughout the journey, he gazed out the window, surprised at how
		similar the sky and the ground really looked. However, the people of the sky looked happier. Perhaps just having
		a clear view of the stars at night and the sun in the morning made people friendlier.



		Astero wore long red robes with intricate golden designs on the low-hanging sleeves. They were soft and silky,
		but thick enough to keep him warm during the winter season. It felt strange to wear something so similar to an
		extravagant dress, but his mother told him they were traditional Fen clan clothes. She also wore all red,
		contrary to Elessai purple. However, she looked more comfortable in those colors. Even her hair, decorated more
		lavishly with a small golden crown-piece over a top-knot and dangling ornaments hanging down the sides of her
		face, suited her more than her normal look. She usually kept all her hair tied up, and Astero hadn't realized
		how long it really was.



		"Everyone in the Fen clan has long hair," his mother added, glancing at the hair he always kept short. "You may
		stand out a bit."



		"Should I grow it out?" he asked jokingly.



		"If you'd like to," she replied, entirely serious.



		He thought about it, then decided against it. It looked to be a pain to wash.



		"Do they know I'm coming?" he asked.



		"Your grandfather knows. I don't know if he told my siblings."



		"Uncle Zhilin, Uncle Luxian, Auntie Meira, and Auntie Anji."



		She nodded, pleased he remembered all their names. "They're not much older than you, actually. Anji's just three
		years older."



		"That's kind of weird."



		His mother laughed. "Perhaps." She stared outside the window of the carriage, a longing expression on her face.
		"I missed them."



		Astero glanced at his mother's face. She didn't outwardly show it, but he could feel how excited she was. One of
		the reasons why he was so close to his mother was because of how isolated the two of them felt in the Elessai
		clan.



		Although, just being in the sky made Astero an outsider, even though no one knew. The only person who did know
		was on the ground.



		Rosella Ozario. Over the years, Astero had learned that the Ozario clan had been declining. Darius and Maeryn
		Ozario were said to have gone mad, and many people had left the clan, all due to the banishment of the youngest
		daughter. He had wanted to visit them, but what would he do? Apologize? Explain to them that she had saved his
		life? Astero was too much of a coward. He could not face them. Thankfully, they no longer attended meetings or
		weddings. He felt ashamed at how relieved he was not to see them at the first meeting he attended, which was the
		discussion of engagement between himself and Melody Dorina.



		"Have you been getting along with Young Lady Dorina?" his mother asked, as if she had read his mind.



		Astero scowled.



		She sighed. "I'll take that as a no."



		"Does it have be her?" Astero looked at his mother with pleading eyes. "I would be fine with anyone but her."



		They had only met in person once, two years ago, to formalize their engagement. Since then, she had been sending
		him letters nonstop, and he had been replying to them, so as not to anger the Dorina clan, but he did so as
		dryly as possible. Whenever he thought the conversation had reached an end and did not reply, she would send him
		more letters. The girl was only eleven years old, and Astero tried to be kind to her, but she was loud and
		spoiled and treated the people around her like dirt.



		"The Dorina clan are the second wealthiest in the north," said his mother. "The alliance will be quite
		powerful."



		"Is there really no one else?" he asked exasperatedly.



		She smiled sadly. "I'm sorry. If it were up to me, you know I'd let you marry whoever you wanted."



		"But it's up to father," he mumbled, slouching back in his seat and crossing his arms.



		"I'm afraid so." She reached over and patted his cheek gently. "Don't worry. You don't have to think about it
		for a while."



		Astero sighed. He didn't even want to think about Melody. He wanted to change the subject. "Do I have any
		cousins there?"



		His mother nodded. "Your Uncle Zhilin has a daughter who's just a few months old. And you have many distant
		relatives."



		"Any my age?"



		She thought for a moment, then frowned. "I'm not sure."



		The two of them would be staying there for a few weeks. Astero desperately hoped he would be able to make
		friends. In the Elessai clan, he was schooled alone.



		Besides, his mother had said that the Fen clan specialized in martial arts. He found that much more appealing
		than the Elessai clan specialties. He also looked more like a Fen than an Elessai. Astero was nervous to visit
		his mother's home, but more than anything, he was excited.



		It took a week of nonstop traveling for them to finally reach the eastern sky. When the Fen clan territory came
		into view, the sight took Astero's breath away. The place was made up of lake towns, with marketplaces and inns
		surrounding the streets. Many bridges were built to cross from one part of town to the next, and boats rode
		underneath them, carrying people everywhere. The architecture was so different from the Elessai, with its tall
		columnar buildings. Fen buildings were layered, with pointed roofs and balconies spanning entire floors. And it
		was a sea of red; red buildings, red clothing, red everywhere.



		Astero looked to his mother. She was staring out the window wistfully, a smile on her face. He was happy for her
		to finally be home after so many years.



		Suddenly, the carriage stopped. The Elessai guard driving called back to them, "We'll have to leave the carriage
		and travel by boat."



		The other guards traveling with them immediately opened the carriage doors and helped them outside. Stepping out
		into the streets, Astero marveled at the sights around him. The atmosphere felt similar to the Elessai clan, but
		it was also different in a way he couldn't explain.



		He and his mother were led to a small wooden rowboat, and they set off for the Fen clan manor, their guards
		trailing behind them. People stopped and stared as they rode along the water, mostly at his mother.



		"Do they know you?" he asked her curiously.



		"Maybe," she replied, looking around. "I visited the town quite often. But I can't imagine they'd still
		recognize me."



		He smiled as she waved at them. Astero had never seen her so happy before.



		Fish of all colors swam beneath the current. Water lilies and lotus flowers decorated the surface. He had seen
		fields of flowers, as the Elessai clan had many. But Astero had never seen anything like this.



		Soon, they reached an area where the town faded away, and trees surrounded the large lake. The Fen clan manor
		came into view, and it was the most beautiful place he had ever laid eyes on. The main building contained many
		stories, but it was connected to smaller structures, with pathways and bridges atop the water leading to all of
		them. Smaller lake houses and pavilions were scattered all around the area, requiring one to travel by boat to
		get there.



		As they drew closer and closer to the manor, Astero saw a figure waiting at the docks. She looked young, wearing
		long red robes and a headpiece similar to his mother's, only without the decorative hanging ornaments. Another
		difference was that the sleeves of her robes were tied with a black band around her forearms, allowing for freer
		movement. As she came closer into view, Astero saw that she was waving her arms excitedly.



		"Mie!" she yelled. "Mie!"



		Astero was confused for a moment before realizing that 'Mie' was an honorific in the Fen clan used to address an
		older sister.



		His mother, who was facing away from the manor, could not see the woman Astero saw, but her eyes widened, and
		then, they filled with tears. She choked back a sob and buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking.



		Astero's heart broke, for his mother rarely cried. When the two of them fought, or when she'd get into arguments
		with his father, she never cried. Josemi Elessai was known for being unmoved and unwavering.



		But just hearing the sound of her little sister's voice was enough to tear down all the walls she had built so
		carefully.



		Astero reached over and pulled his crying mother into his arms, patting her back gently. He was taller than her
		now, and strong enough to care for her the way she did for him.



		"Mother, we're arriving," he said softly.



		She pulled away and hastily wiped her tears, taking deep breaths so as not to cry again.



		The boat finally reached the dock, and Astero's auntie reached in to help his mother out of the boat. His mother
		gazed at her for a moment, as if not quite believing she was real. "Anji?"



		Anji Fen smiled brightly. She hoisted Astero's mother out of the boat, and the two stood face to face on the
		dock. Anji Fen was taller than his mother, and she looked much stronger too. However, just looking at them,
		anyone could tell she was the little sister. She lunged toward his mother, holding her tight in her arms.



		"Welcome back, Mie."



		"How dare you grow taller than me," replied his mother with a smile.



		"I'm taller than Meira Mie too!"



		His mother pulled away, and her hands came up to rest on Anji Fen's cheeks. "I can't believe I haven't seen you
		in nine years."



		"I know, you're so old now!" said Anji Fen, a jokingly worried expression on her face.



		"Watch it, you brat," said his mother pointedly. "Besides, you're eighteen now. When are you getting married?"



		"Father says in two years!" she replied excitedly. "Cy is visiting right now too, so you can meet him!"



		His mother gave a smile, and Astero knew she was relieved their engagement was going well. Her own had been
		necessary to stop a war, and he was already dreading his own.



		"And you can meet my son." She turned towards the boat, where Astero was still sitting, watching their reunion.
		"Astero, this is your Auntie Anji."



		He stepped out of the boat onto the dock and heard the boat sail away as he turned to face them. Anji Fen was
		barely older than him, but he still bowed his head, showing her respect. "It's nice to meet you."



		She squealed and immediately wrapped him up in an unsuspecting hug. "Mie, he's adorable!"



		Astero's mother laughed, but before she could say anything, another voice piped in. "Anji, don't suffocate the
		child."



		Astero looked over Auntie Anji's shoulder and saw another woman. She was dressed in the signature long red
		robes, only she was dressed more elegantly than Auntie Anji, similar to his mother.



		The woman's face was stoic, but the expression in her eyes showed that she was trying to hold back tears. "About
		time, Mie."



		Two more people showed up behind her, and Astero already knew they were his mother's little brothers. One was
		tall, a stern expression on his face. He wore his hair in a top knot, secured by a golden headpiece. His red
		robes were even more intricately designed than Astero's, with beautifully stitched images of dragons. The other
		was smaller, perhaps the same height as Astero. His hair was long and flowed down his back, but he also wore a
		gold band that tied part of it in a top knot. His robes were similar to Auntie Anji's, with bound sleeves and
		less elegant patterns.



		"Astero," said his mother, "this is your Auntie Meira, Uncle Zhilin, and Uncle Luxian."



		Zhilin Fen was the taller one, and he carried himself with extreme poise and elegance, as expected of the clan
		heir. Luxian Fen, on the other hand, had a playful smile on his face.



		"Mie," he said, grinning, "the only one who isn't taller than you now is Meira."



		Auntie Meira rolled her eyes.



		"I believe I had been taller when she left," interjected Uncle Zhilin.



		"No one cares, Sasa," said Auntie Anji, finally letting go of Astero.



		Unexpectedly, the stoic man pouted.



		His mother smiled warmly and walked over to Uncle Zhilin. She looked up at him and sighed. "How are you, Linlin?



		As if he couldn't help himself, Uncle Zhilin threw his arms around her. "I missed you, Mie," he breathed.



		"Group hug!" Uncle Luxian exclaimed, wrapping his arms around the both of them.



		Auntie Meira gazed at them affectionately before joining in.



		Auntie Anji grinned widely. "Come on," she said to Astero, tugging his arm. The two of them joined in the hug,
		and Astero felt awkward hugging anyone but his mother, but seeing the look on her face, he wished this moment
		would never end.
