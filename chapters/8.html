		Josemi paced back and forth in one of the guest rooms in the Dorina clan. The walls were painted blue which was
		supposed to be a calming color, but it did nothing to ease her stress.



		The door opened, and Kairo barged in, shutting the door behind him with a bang.



		"Well?" demanded Josemi.



		Kairo shook his head. "Still no sign of him."



		"Was it the south?" Josemi whispered in horror.



		"It must be," Kairo insisted. "Why else would he go missing the day before his wedding?"



		"They wouldn't kill him," Josemi said with as much confidence she could muster. "They need him somehow. Perhaps
		they want money, or - "



		"Helik Istora just became clan leader. He's been looking for a bride," Kairo reasoned. "Maybe he wants Melody
		for himself."



		Josemi shook her head. "No, I knew him when he was a child. He wouldn't do something like this."



		"People change, Josemi."



		She sighed, sitting down on the large bed. "Do you really think he's been kidnapped?"



		"You're not suggesting he ran away, are you?" His voice sounded dangerous.



		"Perhaps he found a lover and ran away with her," Josemi suggested. The thought was far better than believing
		he'd been kidnapped.



		"If he did indeed do that, I will find him and kill him myself," said Kairo coldly. Then he turned around and
		stormed out of the room.



		Josemi stared after him, a worried expression on her face. Years ago, Kairo had been kinder and more
		understanding. Even when she first brought Astero home, he welcomed the boy as his own son. However, as Astero
		grew older and started having more disagreements with Kairo, her husband has become more easily angered. Things
		only got worse after Astero and Melody became engaged. Astero hated the idea of the marriage, and Kairo was
		furious at Astero for not happily doing his duty to his family.



		The wedding had been postponed for so long due to Astero and Kairo constantly arguing about it. Astero always
		talked of how much he hated Melody. Kairo tried to make him understand that feelings did not matter in political
		marriages, but Astero insisted on not marrying until he was ready. Her son was twenty-three years old now, older
		than she was when she married Kairo.



		Josemi buried her face in her hands, wondering when her family started to fall apart.



		A knock on the door startled her, and she quickly composed herself before calling, "Come in!"



		The door opened, and in walked a woman Josemi had never met. She had short dark brown hair, tan skin, and eyes
		nearly black. She wore a long dress that was mostly black but with a pink bodice. On her head was a crown of
		flowers.



		She smiled at Josemi, and it unnerved her.



		"Josemi Elessai," said the woman, her voice deep and haunting. "A pleasure to meet you."



		Josemi nodded her head in acknowledgement, trying to hide her unease. "May I ask who you are?"



		"Willow," she replied simply, no mention of a last name. "I'm sorry to hear about your son."



		"Why are you here?" Josemi demanded, unable to contain herself. The mention of Astero pushed her off the edge.



		Willow held up a hand. "I mean no harm. I was here for the wedding like everyone else. Such a shame." Willow had
		a sad look on her face that was more than obviously fake. She turned around, and Josemi thought she was going to
		leave, but Willow only closed the door behind her. When she turned back to face Josemi, her lips were curved
		into a smile. "Fortunately for you, I may know where he is."



		Josemi's heart stopped. "Tell me," she breathed, too shocked to make her voice any louder.



		"He was not kidnapped, although that is what everyone is thinking," said Willow as she walked across the room to
		the vanity, fixing her flower crown in the mirror. She seemed so careless about a topic that was of immense
		importance to Josemi. "He ran away."



		"How do you know this?" Josemi asked, mostly curious.



		"Unimportant," she replied lazily, pulling out the chair of the vanity and sitting casually in it, as if this
		were her room. "Lady Elessai, I'd like to make a deal with you."



		Josemi she felt a chill in her bones. "What sort of deal?"



		"Actually, let me ask you this first. Who do you love more: your husband or your son?"



		Fifteen years ago, she would not have been able to answer. But now, she said without hesitation, "My son."



		"That's what I thought," said Willow with a smile. Her features were paradoxical to her attitude. Willow's face
		was round with no sharp angles, making her look younger than most people. Her eyes were wide, too big for her
		face. But when she smiled, it looked all wrong, like an older woman trapped in a little girl's body.



		Josemi mostly felt relieved that Astero had not been kidnapped. All her worries from the whole day dissipated
		the moment she found that out. And as Willow kept talking, Josemi realized that she genuinely wanted to know
		more about this deal they would make.



		"So here's what I'd like to do." Willow glanced around the room and scowled. "Blue is such an awful color, don't
		you think?"



		"Get to the point, will you?"



		Willow chuckled, amused. "Right, right." Then, her face turned dark, almost frightening. "There are four people
		I'd like brought to their knees. I'm hoping you can help me with this."



		Josemi said nothing.



		Willow held up a fist. "Kalwen Dorina," she said, lifting one finger. "Safiro Jourman." Another finger. "Yanni
		Lem." A third. "And Kairo Elessai." A fourth. She waved those four finger, eyes filled with mirth.



		"What will you give me in exchange for my husband?" asked Josemi.



		"Your son, of course." Willow stood up from the chair and walked to the window, gazing out into sky. "I will
		have him brought to you, alive and well. I will also ensure his protection. Once people find out where he's
		been, they're not going to celebrate this marriage any longer."



		"You still have not told me where he is."



		"The ground."



		The fear that had dissipated in Josemi came back all at once, like a tidal wave crashing into her at full force.



		"To be honest, I don't know why he's there," said Willow. "Some informants of mine saw him descend the stairway,
		and he has not come up since."



		Josemi would rather he be kidnapped than be on the ground. Why would he willingly descend the staircase?
		Josemi's mother used to tell her stories of what kinds of horrors waited on the ground. A place full of evil
		people, waiting to destroy the sky people that wronged them. Josemi felt for the people from the sky being sent
		to the ground, for that is a fate worse than death.



		Her breathing had grown harsh, and she clenched her trembling fists.



		"I'm certain I can find him," continued Willow, striding back to the vanity. "But when the time comes, I'll need
		you to give this to Lord Elessai, Lady Lem, Lady Dorina, and Lord Jourman." She took out a small glass bottle
		with a wooden stopper at the top and set it down on the table.



		"Poison?" she whispered harshly.



		"Not quite, but why does that matter?" Willow strolled toward the door. "Keep it safe and hidden. I'll instruct
		you later on what to do with it."



		"And Astero? You'll find him?" Josemi pleaded.



		"You have my word," said Willow, smiling, lips red as blood. "All I need is yours."



		Josemi stared at the vial on her desk. Although her love for Kairo faded as time went by, she still cared for
		him. She was a devoted wife. He had been kind to her, a nineteen year-old foreigner from the eastern sky. They
		had been married for seventeen years. In all that time, she never hated him.



		But Astero was more important.



		She knew he would never do it, but if he wanted to kill Astero for running away, she would defend him at all
		costs. Josemi couldn't understand why her son would choose to run away to the ground rather than anywhere in the
		sky, but as long as he could be found, it didn't matter.



		So she nodded. "I'll do it."



		Willow didn't look surprised. She just smiled, opened the door, and glided out of the room.



		Josemi let out a shuddering breath. Her husband, and all the clan leaders, in exchange for her son. She wondered
		what they had done to this woman, why she would risk going to the ground just to see them brought to their
		knees.



		She supposed it didn't matter, so long as Astero was brought back safely.
