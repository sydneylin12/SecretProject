Willow thought the little girl was a wounded dog licking its wounds. She sa=
w the blood first, followed by the pungent odor. Stepping around the corner=
, she came face to face with a creature covered in filth, with arms and leg=
s as thin as bone. It wasn't until Willow saw her eyes, thin and dark and b=
lazing with suspicion, that she realized it was a human girl.=20

Homeless orphans were not uncommon in the Sanu clan. They were, however, tr=
eated far worse compared to other clans. The few orphanages that existed we=
re run-down and poorly managed, and neither the Sanu family nor the other n=
obles were interested in doing anything about it.=20

The Sanu clan had an abundance of wealth, spent mostly on warfare and riche=
s for the noble families. The Sanu clan manor was beautiful. It was entirel=
y one-story, but the area it covered spanned over a great distance. Surroun=
ded by a botanical garden, with gorgeous stone pathways, bonsai trees, and =
little streams filled with koi fish, Willow was certain it was the most bea=
utiful manor she had seen. Because the nobles lived in such luxury, this le=
ft most of the citizens to rot. The lower towns were in terrible shape. Cri=
me and poverty overtook those areas, and since the Sanu were at war with th=
e Fen, the towns were occasionally soaked with blood.=20

She had stayed in the Sanu clan for just a few months, visiting every town =
she could. This town was in a particularly bad spot, being the most eastern=
 spot in the western clan. Whenever the Fen attacked, this town was the fir=
st one to go through. However, this girl seemed to be in the worst shape ou=
t of everyone Willow had seen there.=20

The girl's arms and legs were a mix of brown and red, as dirt and dried blo=
od coated her body. A mess of shredded fabric covered her torso. Her face w=
as barely visible amidst the soot, and only her eyes could be clearly seen.=
 They were hooded and sharp and stared at Willow.=20

Staring in horror, Willow could not even give a comforting smile. "What hap=
pened to you?"

The girl said nothing. She gazed back at Willow, who started to feel uncomf=
ortable.=20

"Here, let me help," said Willow, stepping closer.=20

The girl flinched back and whipped out a sharp blade, pointing it directly =
at Willow.=20

Willow had learned how to fight by studying Fen clan warriors. She knew how=
 to recognize an attack and how to react quickly. However, this girl had no=
 intention of attacking and would only seem to use the blade in self-defens=
e.=20

So she said softly, "I just want to help you."=20

Her eyes only blazed with more suspicion.=20

This made Willow frustrated, so she said more firmly, "If you don't get hel=
p, you'll bleed out and die."=20

The knife wavered ever so slightly.=20

"Can you stand?"=20

Willow saw the girl hesitate, but after a moment, she slowly nodded. Pushin=
g herself up to stand on her frighteningly thin legs, Willow was almost afr=
aid the girl would topple over, but she made no attempts to help. That woul=
d likely only scare her.=20

Once she was fully standing, Willow said, "My house is not far from here. I=
 have medical supplies I can treat you with." She started walking, and afte=
r hearing the tiny footsteps following behind her, she breathed a sigh of r=
elief.=20

Willow's home in the Sanu clan was a small shack in the village that she bo=
ught for less than the normal price of a dress in any other clan. She rarel=
y stated there, spending most of her time traveling throughout the clan's m=
any towns and villages. However, it was perfect for times like this.=20

The little girl followed her through the dreary village, and Willow walked =
slow enough to allow her to keep up. Every now and then, Willow glanced ove=
r her shoulder, and the girl was always staring right at her, eyes full of =
suspicion with a hint of curiosity.=20

"Do you speak?" Willow asked.=20

"Yes," the girl replied, so quiet Willow almost missed it. Her voice sounde=
d rough, as if it hadn't been used in a while.=20

"What's your name?"=20

"Kona."=20

"Where are your parents?"=20

She shrugged.=20

"Where do you live?"=20

"Where you found me."=20

Willow shook her head in disbelief. "Don't they have an orphanage you can s=
tay in?"=20

When Willow glanced back, Kona rolled her eyes. "It's worse in the orphanag=
e."=20

Before Willow could reply, someone shouted, "Stop that girl!" and came hurt=
ling towards them from the marketplace street.=20

Willow turned to Kona, but the girl had already taken off running.=20

"Stop her!" The man stopped by Willow, panting, pure rage on his face. "Go =
on, get her!"=20

And she did, not because she took orders from anyone, but because the girl =
was hurt and alone, and either she went after Kona or the man would. Willow=
 sprinted in the direction Kona took off running, passing by curious onlook=
ers.=20

It wasn't hard catching up to Kona. The girl was fast, but compared to Will=
ow, there was hardly competition. Willow ran in front of Kona and stopped, =
forcing the girl to stop in her tracks as well.=20

Panic filled Kona's eyes, and she glanced in all directions around her for =
an escape route. Realizing that in front was Willow, behind her was the man=
, and to her sides were throngs of villagers standing by.=20

Kona moved to one side and took out her knife, and when the man finally cau=
ght up to them, she waved it between him and Willow, baring her teeth like =
a rabid animal.=20

The man stomped towards her angrily, his arms outstretched as if to grab he=
r. Willow heard Kona suck in a breath, and the fierce stare the girl had ea=
rlier turned into fear.=20

In a split second, Willow was in between them, shielding Kona protectively.=
 "What do you think you're doing?" she demanded.=20

"This girl stole from me!" he yelled, spitting as he spoke.=20

Willow craned her neck to face Kona, who looked up at her with guilty eyes.=
 She gave her a reassuring smile before turning to face the man, scrutinizi=
ng him. "What did she steal?"=20

"The clothes she's wearing!" he replied, fuming. "Stole it right from my ca=
rt!"=20

Kona had been wearing a shirt that appeared to just be torn fabric loosely =
worn on her body. "It's already ripped apart," noted Willow.=20

"Did that myself." The man seemed quite proud of himself. "I'll finish her =
off. Step aside."=20

Willow did not know where this bout of rage came from, but suddenly, red ap=
peared in her vision, and she pulled out a blade from a strap on her leg th=
at had been hidden by a cloak. Pointing it directly at the man, she said th=
rough gritted teeth, "Do not touch her."=20

The man scoffed, stepping closer. Willow felt a tug at her cloak, but she d=
id not let her eyes leave the enemy in front of her. "Take another step, an=
d you're a dead man."=20

His eyes blazed with anger. "She's a thief!"=20

"She's a child."=20

"Child or not, criminals need to pay for their crimes." The man took anothe=
r step.=20

Willow brought up the knife, and in one swift arc, she cut open the man's t=
hroat. His eyes widened in horror, at the realization that death was upon h=
im, and he fell to the ground face-first, blood spooling out from his wound=
.=20

Being away from home for nine years, Willow had met all kinds of people. As=
 a young woman traveling the sky alone, she had to learn how to be ruthless=
, or anyone could easily take advantage of her. She learned how to numb the=
 painful feeling when killing someone, how to silence the part of her mind =
that called her a monster.=20

For a moment, the village was shocked into silence. Then, as if they were u=
sed to such things happening, they all turned away and went about their bus=
iness like nothing had happened.=20

The tug at her cloak came again, and Willow turned to face the girl.=20

Kona gazed at her curiously. "Why did you save me?"=20

Willow bent down. She wasn't much taller than Kona. Soon, the girl would gr=
ow to tower over her, and the thought made Willow smile. "I decided I quite=
 like you."=20

"But =E2=80=94 " Kona shook her head. "He was telling the truth. I stole fr=
om him."=20

"And?"=20

Kona looked bewildered. "You're not going to punish me?"=20

"I will fix your wounds first." Willow held out a hand. "Then I will scold =
you and get you new clothes."=20

Kona stared at Willow's hand. After a moment, she placed her own small hand=
 into it.=20

"Are you my guardian angel?" Kona whispered in amazement.=20

Laughter bubbled up inside Willow, and the girl's previously suspicious and=
 curious eyes seemed to sparkle. "I'm Willow. From now on, I'll take care o=
f you."
