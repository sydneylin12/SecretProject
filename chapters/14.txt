"So, last week I was hired to clean the outside of Mr. Hestyn's house today=
," explained Rosella as she and Astero walked through the village. "It will=
 likely take the whole day, we will be outside the whole time, and it is th=
e height of summer."=20

"You were going to do this yourself?" Astero demanded. He was carrying her =
bag for her, and his tall body blocked Rosella from the sun. She didn't wan=
t to admit it, but she was happy he came along.=20

"I've always done things like this myself," she replied easily. "The pay is=
 very good, too."=20

He shook his head in disbelief. "I wish I had found you earlier," Astero mu=
rmured, so quietly Rosella almost didn't hear.=20

She felt a bit offended. "I didn't need your help before. I am capable, you=
 know."=20

"I know," he said quietly. "That's not what I meant."=20

Rosella tried to look at him, but the sun was shining too brightly for her =
squinting eyes.=20

He was a mystery. Astero. She didn't even know his last name, how old he wa=
s, or what he planned to do. He just showed up out of the blue and became t=
he first person who has helped Rosella without wanting anything in return. =
They had just met, so why did it feel like they had known each for longer?=
=20

Suddenly, Astero gasped. "Wait here."=20

Before she could say anything, he dashed off towards a random stall in the =
marketplace, and it was too bright for Rosella to follow him with her eyes.=
 She tried to block the sun with her hand and made an attempt not to melt i=
n the sweltering heat as she waited for him to return.

After a few moments of just standing there under the sun, Rosella felt some=
thing being placed onto her head. She looked up and saw Astero standing in =
front of her, smiling brighter than the blue sky.=20

He had bought her a hat, and Rosella had to bite her lip to keep from cryin=
g.=20

Years ago, when Rosella was relatively new to the ground, she met a man she=
 believed had loved her.=20

He was charming, handsome, older. She thought he would take care of her.=20

It was summer. The first summer she spent on the ground. The man took her i=
n and treated her well. To repay his kindness, she agreed to work for him.=
=20

Rosella stayed with him for months. She learned to cook for him. She learne=
d to clean for him. She did everything he asked. And he always told her how=
 much he loved her. He would hug and kiss her, lay with her, and hold her c=
lose as they slept together. He said she was the most beautiful girl he had=
 ever seen, and she was young and alone and wanted someone to love her.

Until one day, before she turned fourteen years old, Rosella bled for the f=
irst time. And suddenly, he didn't love her anymore.=20

He would ignore her when she tried talking to him. He stopped letting her s=
leep in his bed. He wouldn't thank her for the meals she made or the chores=
 she finished. His smiling face transformed into pure disgust whenever he l=
ooked at her.=20

Another summer arrived, and his behavior didn't change. All the while, Rose=
lla couldn't understand what she had done wrong. Her fourteenth birthday ar=
rived, and she genuinely believed he would be nicer to her that day. Rosell=
a went out to the market and bought herself a new dress and new shoes, and =
because it was so bright outside, she bought a hat as well. It was made of =
straw with a large brim, and a white ribbon was tied around the top.=20

Rosella entered his house and saw him sitting at the dining table. He looke=
d up when she came in, and she smiled as sweetly as she could, trying to lo=
ok prettier than she ever had before.=20

However, she was not expecting him to stand up violently, tear the dress an=
d hat off her, grab her by the arm, and throw her outside. He tossed her ha=
t and torn dress onto the ground with ferocity, as if he couldn't bear to l=
ook at them. Then, he shut the door and locked it, clearly indicating she s=
hould never come back.=20

Passerby stared at her, but no one stopped to do anything. Rosella, clad on=
ly in her undergarments, slowly crawled over to where he had tossed the hat=
, and shakily placed it on her head. She was too shocked to cry, to speak, =
to do much of anything. She wandered around the village during the night, f=
inding food in people's trash and nearly dying from the heat. During the da=
ytime, Rosella slept outside, covering her face with the hat to block the s=
un. She wanted a place to stay. She wanted food and water. But mostly, she =
wanted her parents.=20

Soon enough, Rosella realized she couldn't live that way anymore. And so, s=
he set out for a new village, abandoning the first home she had on the grou=
nd. She left the hat somewhere, leaving it behind with the memories of that=
 place

Rosella had never bought herself another one. Perhaps somewhere inside her,=
 she believed it would remind her too much of what had happened. But now, l=
ooking up at Astero's smiling face, for the first time in a long time, she =
felt cared for.=20

"Do you want something from me?" Rosella asked, just to make sure.=20

His eyebrows crinkled together with confusion. "No?"=20

A river of relief washed over her, and under the scorching sun, she felt a =
refreshing breeze.=20

"Do you like it?" he asked.=20

She smiled, steeled herself, and hooked his arm through hers. "I love it."=
=20

The two of them walked together, arm in arm, through the village on a brigh=
t summer day. This village was definitely much better than the ones she had=
 lived in previously. The people did not treat her harshly, and she finally=
 found a residence where only a woman lived, even though Jayda could be rud=
e at times. Rosella learned over time to not mention that she came from the=
 sky. The residents here hated the sky people as much as any other town on =
the ground.=20

She wondered how her parents were doing. She hoped they found happiness aft=
er she left. Rosella couldn't live with herself if something happened to th=
em because of her actions long ago.=20

Beneath the wide brim of her new hat, she looked up and saw the land of the=
 sky hovering in the clouds. This village was located in the north, and it =
warmed her heart to know her parents were right above her. Although she cou=
ld not see them, Rosella felt content just being close to them. As of now, =
her life of fifteen years on the ground had been longer than the thirteen s=
he spent in the sky. Rosella only had faint memories from living there, and=
 she feared that soon, she would forget all about it.=20

Standing close to Astero, Rosella clutched his arm tighter, feeling the com=
forting warmth radiating from him. Somehow, he reminded her of home. He rem=
inded her of a time when she wasn't alone.=20

"Are you all right?" he asked, concern seeping into his voice. "Is it still=
 too hot?"=20

She shook her head, looking up at him. He stared down at her, his face illu=
minated by golden light. "What about you?"=20

"It's warm," he replied, closing his eyes, a slight smile on his face. "But=
 it feels nice."=20

"Does it get this hot in Ludha?"=20

"Sometimes," he replied, not even looking like he was sweating. "My mother =
is from the east, and they have the hottest summers I've ever experienced. =
This doesn't come close."=20

Rosella had never been to the eastern part of the world. She was dropped of=
f in the west and simply made her way north.=20

"How long have you been away from home?" Rosella asked.=20

"A few days." He shrugged. "It feels longer."=20

"You really don't want to marry this girl?"=20

Astero scowled. "I do not."=20

"What's so bad about her?"=20

He sighed, running his fingers through his hair. "I've only met her twice, =
and that was too much for me already."=20

"Elaborate."=20

"She's just... loud. Always complaining. And clings onto me when I don't wa=
nt her to."=20

Rosella was suddenly aware of her arm hugging his own, and she slowly attem=
pted to let go, chuckling awkwardly.=20

He immediately hooked their arms tighter together. "No, I didn't - I mean, =
it's okay when it's you," he said hurriedly.=20

She smiled with relief.=20

"She's... spoiled. Arrogant. Thinks she's above everyone else."=20

"Well," said Rosella, "then I will help you hide here so you never have to =
marry her."=20

Astero grinned. "I appreciate that."=20

After walking a few more minutes, they finally arrived in front of Mr. Hest=
yn's house. The outside walls which were supposed to be white were covered =
in moss and was nearly browning. Mr. Hestyn was one of the richest people i=
n the village, and only someone of his wealth status would pay to have the =
outside of their house cleaned.=20

Rosella and Astero strolled to the front door. Rosella knocked once and the=
 door swung open. A woman, likely Mr. Hestyn's maid, stood there scowling.=
=20

"You're late," she said, lips twisted in disdain.=20

"My apologies," replied Rosella, lowering her head. "Mr. Hestyn did not spe=
cify a time."=20

"He shouldn't have to," snapped the maid.=20

"Of course," Rosella said, nodding in agreement. She always found it easier=
 to agree than argue back. "My apologies again."=20

She could feel Astero tensing up, and she squeezed his arm in reassurance.=
=20

"Mr. Hestyn will be back later today," explained the maid. She glanced at A=
stero. "I'll have you know, the pay will not be doubled."

"I'm a volunteer," he said flatly.=20

She raised an eyebrow questioningly but did not comment on it. "You may beg=
in work immediately." Then she shut the door in their faces.=20

Rosella saw that Astero was glaring at the door, so she tugged his arm. He =
huffed but did not complain, allowing Rosella to lead him to the side of th=
e house where their work would begin.=20

"I can take three sides of the house, you can take one," said Rosella takin=
g her bag from him and getting out all the cleaning supplies they'd need.=
=20

"No, I'll take three," he insisted.

"Absolutely not," she replied sternly.=20

"Fine, I'll take all of them." He took the large sponge and bottle of soap =
from her hands. "You go rest somewhere."=20

"Astero!"=20

"Rosella."=20

She sighed frustratedly. "You can't keep doing things for me."=20

"Why not?"=20

Because I can't do anything for you.

"I need to work to earn money."=20

"I'll give you all the money," he reassured.=20

"That's not - !"=20

"Rosella." He set the cleaning supplies down on the stool next to the house=
 and placed both hands on her shoulders. "I just want to help. I want to ma=
ke things easier for you."=20

She couldn't understand him. He was so different from anyone she had ever m=
et. How could someone be so willing to help another person for nothing in r=
eturn? Everything she did was for her own sake. She didn't deserve his kind=
ness.=20

The space in her heart for him grew larger and larger the more time she spe=
nt with him. She had met many people over the years: there were some who wa=
nted her services, there were others who wanted her body, and there were th=
ose who wanted nothing to do with her after finding out she was once from t=
he sky.=20

Astero didn't want anything from her. For the first time in so long, there =
was someone who genuinely wanted to help her, to be around her, without wan=
ting anything in return.=20

"Let's just work together then," she decided, picking up the cleaning suppl=
ies from the ground. "Every wall, we'll work on it together."=20

"Are you sure? Because I can - "

She held up a hand. "That is what I'm willing to compromise."=20

He hesitated, but eventually, Astero agreed. And so the two of them worked =
all throughout the humid summer day. Rosella usually did this kind of work =
alone, but working with Astero from morning to evening, struggling and laug=
hing together, she realized that this was what she had always wanted.

"It will likely take the whole day, we will be outside the whole time, and it is the height of summer."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You were going to do this yourself?" Astero demanded. He was carrying her bag for her, and his tall body blocked Rosella from the sun. She didn't want to admit it, but she was happy he came along.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I've always done things like this myself," she replied easily. "The pay is very good, too."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He shook his head in disbelief. "I wish I had found you earlier," Astero murmured, so quietly Rosella almost didn't hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She felt a bit offended. "I didn't need your help before. I am capable, you know."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I know," he said quietly. "That's not what I meant."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella tried to look at him, but the sun was shining too brightly for her squinting eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He was a mystery. Astero. She didn't even know his last name, how old he was, or what he planned to do. He just showed up out of the blue and became the first person who has helped Rosella without wanting anything in return. They had just met, so why did it feel like they had known each for longer?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Suddenly, Astero gasped. "Wait here."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Before she could say anything, he dashed off towards a random stall in the marketplace, and it was too bright for Rosella to follow him with her eyes. She tried to block the sun with her hand and made an attempt not to melt in the sweltering heat as she waited for him to return.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">After a few moments of just standing there under the sun, Rosella felt something being placed onto her head. She looked up and saw Astero standing in front of her, smiling brighter than the blue sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He had bought her a hat, and Rosella had to bite her lip to keep from crying.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Years ago, when Rosella was relatively new to the ground, she met a man she believed had loved her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He was charming, handsome, older. She thought he would take care of her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">It was summer. The first summer she spent on the ground. The man took her in and treated her well. To repay his kindness, she agreed to work for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella stayed with him for months. She learned to cook for him. She learned to clean for him. She did everything he asked. And he always told her how much he loved her. He would hug and kiss her, lay with her, and hold her close as they slept together. He said she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, and she was young and alone and wanted someone to love her.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Until one day, before she turned fourteen years old, Rosella bled for the first time. And suddenly, he didn't love her anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He would ignore her when she tried talking to him. He stopped letting her sleep in his bed. He wouldn't thank her for the meals she made or the chores she finished. His smiling face transformed into pure disgust whenever he looked at her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Another summer arrived, and his behavior didn't change. All the while, Rosella couldn't understand what she had done wrong. Her fourteenth birthday arrived, and she genuinely believed he would be nicer to her that day. Rosella went out to the market and bought herself a new dress and new shoes, and because it was so bright outside, she bought a hat as well. It was made of straw with a large brim, and a white ribbon was tied around the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella entered his house and saw him sitting at the dining table. He looked up when she came in, and she smiled as sweetly as she could, trying to look prettier than she ever had before.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">However, she was not expecting him to stand up violently, tear the dress and hat off her, grab her by the arm, and throw her outside. He tossed her hat and torn dress onto the ground with ferocity, as if he couldn't bear to look at them. Then, he shut the door and locked it, clearly indicating she should never come back.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Passerby stared at her, but no one stopped to do anything. Rosella, clad only in her undergarments, slowly crawled over to where he had tossed the hat, and shakily placed it on her head. She was too shocked to cry, to speak, to do much of anything. She wandered around the village during the night, finding food in people's trash and nearly dying from the heat. During the daytime, Rosella slept outside, covering her face with the hat to block the sun. She wanted a place to stay. She wanted food and water. But mostly, she wanted her parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Soon enough, Rosella realized she couldn't live that way anymore. And so, she set out for a new village, abandoning the first home she had on the ground. She left the hat somewhere, leaving it behind with the memories of that place</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella had never bought herself another one. Perhaps somewhere inside her, she believed it would remind her too much of what had happened. But now, looking up at Astero's smiling face, for the first time in a long time, she felt cared for.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Do you want something from me?" Rosella asked, just to make sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">His eyebrows crinkled together with confusion. "No?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">A river of relief washed over her, and under the scorching sun, she felt a refreshing breeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Do you like it?" he asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She smiled, steeled herself, and hooked his arm through hers. "I love it."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The two of them walked together, arm in arm, through the village on a bright summer day. This village was definitely much better than the ones she had lived in previously. The people did not treat her harshly, and she finally found a residence where only a woman lived, even though Jayda could be rude at times. Rosella learned over time to not mention that she came from the sky. The residents here hated the sky people as much as any other town on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She wondered how her parents were doing. She hoped they found happiness after she left. Rosella couldn't live with herself if something happened to them because of her actions long ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Beneath the wide brim of her new hat, she looked up and saw the land of the sky hovering in the clouds. This village was located in the north, and it warmed her heart to know her parents were right above her. Although she could not see them, Rosella felt content just being close to them. As of now, her life of fifteen years on the ground had been longer than the thirteen she spent in the sky. Rosella only had faint memories from living there, and she feared that soon, she would forget all about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Standing close to Astero, Rosella clutched his arm tighter, feeling the comforting warmth radiating from him. Somehow, he reminded her of home. He reminded her of a time when she wasn't alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Are you all right?" he asked, concern seeping into his voice. "Is it still too hot?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She shook her head, looking up at him. He stared down at her, his face illuminated by golden light. "What about you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"It's warm," he replied, closing his eyes, a slight smile on his face. "But it feels nice."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Does it get this hot in Ludha?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Sometimes," he replied, not even looking like he was sweating. "My mother is from the east, and they have the hottest summers I've ever experienced. This doesn't come close."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella had never been to the eastern part of the world. She was dropped off in the west and simply made her way north.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"How long have you been away from home?" Rosella asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"A few days." He shrugged. "It feels longer."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You really don't want to marry this girl?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Astero scowled. "I do not."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What's so bad about her?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He sighed, running his fingers through his hair. "I've only met her twice, and that was too much for me already."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Elaborate."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"She's just... loud. Always complaining. And clings onto me when I don't want her to."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella was suddenly aware of her arm hugging his own, and she slowly attempted to let go, chuckling awkwardly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He immediately hooked their arms tighter together. "No, I didn't - I mean, it's okay when it's you," he said hurriedly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She smiled with relief.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"She's... spoiled. Arrogant. Thinks she's above everyone else."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Well," said Rosella, "then I will help you hide here so you never have to marry her."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Astero grinned. "I appreciate that."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">After walking a few more minutes, they finally arrived in front of Mr. Hestyn's house. The outside walls which were supposed to be white were covered in moss and was nearly browning. Mr. Hestyn was one of the richest people in the village, and only someone of his wealth status would pay to have the outside of their house cleaned.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella and Astero strolled to the front door. Rosella knocked once and the door swung open. A woman, likely Mr. Hestyn's maid, stood there scowling.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You're late," she said, lips twisted in disdain.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"My apologies," replied Rosella, lowering her head. "Mr. Hestyn did not specify a time."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"He shouldn't have to," snapped the maid.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Of course," Rosella said, nodding in agreement. She always found it easier to agree than argue back. "My apologies again."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She could feel Astero tensing up, and she squeezed his arm in reassurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Mr. Hestyn will be back later today," explained the maid. She glanced at Astero. "I'll have you know, the pay will not be doubled."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm a volunteer," he said flatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She raised an eyebrow questioningly but did not comment on it. "You may begin work immediately." Then she shut the door in their faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Rosella saw that Astero was glaring at the door, so she tugged his arm. He huffed but did not complain, allowing Rosella to lead him to the side of the house where their work would begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I can take three sides of the house, you can take one," said Rosella taking her bag from him and getting out all the cleaning supplies they'd need.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"No, I'll take three," he insisted.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Absolutely not," she replied sternly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Fine, I'll take all of them." He took the large sponge and bottle of soap from her hands. "You go rest somewhere."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Astero!"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Rosella."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She sighed frustratedly. "You can't keep doing things for me."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Why not?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);"><span style="font-style: italic;">Because I can't do anything for you.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I need to work to earn money."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'll give you all the money," he reassured.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"That's not - !"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Rosella." He set the cleaning supplies down on the stool next to the house and placed both hands on her shoulders. "I just want to help. I want to make things easier for you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She couldn't understand him. He was so different from anyone she had ever met. How could someone be so willing to help another person for nothing in return? Everything she did was for her own sake. She didn't deserve his kindness.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The space in her heart for him grew larger and larger the more time she spent with him. She had met many people over the years: there were some who wanted her services, there were others who wanted her body, and there were those who wanted nothing to do with her after finding out she was once from the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Astero didn't want anything from her. For the first time in so long, there was someone who genuinely wanted to help her, to be around her, without wanting anything in return.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Let's just work together then," she decided, picking up the cleaning supplies from the ground. "Every wall, we'll work on it together."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Are you sure? Because I can - "</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She held up a hand. "That is what I'm willing to compromise."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">He hesitated, but eventually, Astero agreed. And so the two of them worked all throughout the humid summer day. Rosella usually did this kind of work alone, but working with Astero from morning to evening, struggling and laughing together, she realized that this was what she had always wanted.</p><br><div dir="ltr">Sent from my iPhone</div></div></body></html>
