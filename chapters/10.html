		After moving all those antiques and trinkets down to the basement and carefully avoiding conversation with Jayda
		as he did so, Astero went back to his room and realized for the first time that he did not have a bed. He
		sighed, looking around the nearly empty room. There was a dusty table in the corner with an even more dusty
		wardrobe next to it. An armchair was placed near the corner by the window where age-old curtains hung. He
		supposed he could just sleep in the armchair. It would likely be more comfortable than the hard wooden floor.



		Astero wondered if he should go out to buy more things for Rosella. She had said she didn't want anything else,
		but surely she wouldn't refuse them if he bought gifts without her knowledge and left them in her room
		anonymously. He admitted that the necklace might have been overkill, but he truly meant that she could sell it
		if she didn't want it.



		A knock sounded on his door, and his heart leapt out of his chest. He opened it to see Rosella standing there.
		She looked up at him, her wide dark brown eyes filling him with warmth. He remembered those eyes so clearly,
		even though the last time he saw them was fifteen years ago. Astero saw them clearer now than he did in the
		marketplace. They were the same color as his, but rounder and brighter. She had long eyelashes and was as pretty
		as he remembered, but her face was sunken in, and shadows crested under her eyes. Rosella was also shorter than
		him now, and much thinner. She wore a beige dress with a white apron over it. He hated seeing her in colors so
		plain. She deserved to wear the bright pink of the Ozario clan. Perhaps tomorrow she would wear the dress he
		bought her.



		He knew from the moment he saw her that her life on the ground had not been easy. Astero had been looking for
		her all these years, and when he finally laid eyes on her, she was being slapped in the face and forced to work
		a flower stall. He felt boiling rage and crippling misery, but mostly, he just felt guilt.



		This was all his fault, and he feared that if Rosella knew who he really was, she would hate him. After all, he
		was the little boy who destroyed her entire life.



		He vowed to never tell her his true identity. All he could do was thank her in other ways. Whatever she needed,
		he would give to her. He would protect her the way she did for him fifteen years ago.



		"Dinner's ready!" she said cheerfully.



		Astero sighed. It wasn't going so well if she was the one making him dinner. He wanted to make her life easier,
		not cause her more trouble. Tomorrow, he would buy her all the food she wanted.



		But for now, he nodded. "Thank you, Rosella."



		He followed her downstairs where Jayda was already wolfing down the meal Rosella made. She looked up, saw
		Astero, and almost spit out her mouth full of food.



		Jayda visibly swallowed everything in her mouth. "Astero!" she exclaimed, immediately standing up. "Sit, sit."



		Astero laughed awkwardly, pulling out a chair and seating himself at the round table.



		It wasn't until he looked at a standing Rosella that he realized there were only two chairs.



		He pushed back from the table and stood abruptly. "I'm so sorry," he apologized. Astero stepped back and
		gestured to the chair. "Please sit."



		Rosella looked surprised. "Oh, I'll eat later."



		Aster was confused. "Later?"



		"When you're finished," she clarified.



		"You needn't worry about her, Young Master," assured Jayda. "She's just a servant. She'll eat whatever's left."



		Astero tried to calm the burning rage inside of him. He took a deep breath and summoned all the politeness and
		courtesy his mother had taught him so he would not snap at Jayda. "It would be rude to eat without her. She
		cooked the meal after all."



		"Because that's her job," Jayda said easily, continuing to eat.



		"I'm afraid I cannot eat until she does."



		Jayda looked up at him, seeming to be confused. "Why?"



		He resisted the urge to scream.



		"Astero," said Rosella's voice from behind him. He turned to look at her, an uncomfortable expression on her
		face. "You're a guest. Just eat."



		"Yes, help yourself!" encouraged Jayda.



		He looked at Rosella helplessly, but her eyes turned to the floor, making no indication that she would heed his
		concerns.



		Astero couldn't just refuse to eat. She had gone through the trouble of making extra food for him. But he would
		not let her simply have their table scraps. So he served food onto his own plate, waited a few moments, and
		said, "Actually, I have terrible indigestion at the moment. I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me." He stood
		up and turned to Rosella. "Please, you'll have to eat all these leftovers for me."



		Rosella blinked.



		Jayda looked concerned. "Do you need anything, Young Master?"



		He shook his head. "No thank you, Lady Jayda. I'll just be in my room."



		He headed for the stairs, passing Rosella on his way there. Her eyes followed him with curiosity, but she said
		nothing.



		As he made his way up, he heard Jayda say, "Well sit down then, Rosella. The food's getting cold," and he
		breathed a sigh of relief.



		Astero made his way back to his room. He pulled out one of the books he bought from the marketplace and sat in
		the armchair, reading to pass the time.



		He didn't know when he fell asleep, but a knock at his door woke him up. He jumped out of the chair and opened
		the door where Rosella stood, the blackberry pie he bought for her in his hands.



		"Can I come in?" she asked.



		He nodded, stepping aside to let her pass. She slowly stepped inside and looked around. Suddenly, she gasped.
		"You don't have a bed."



		Astero chuckled. "It's alright, I'll manage."



		"Without a bed?" She turned to him incredulously. "Where will you sleep?"



		"The armchair is quite comfortable."



		Rosella shook her head. "I have a spare mat and blankets. Give me one moment." She handed the pie to him and
		went to her room. When she came back, she had brought what she said she would. Rosella spread out the mat and
		blankets on the floor and grimaced. "I'm sorry, I don't think the mat's long enough for you."



		He smiled and walked over to stand next to her, admiring the worn-out mat and thin blankets on the floor. "It's
		perfect. Thank you."



		She turned to face him with scrutinizing eyes. "You didn't actually have indigestion, did you?"



		He said nothing.



		Rosella sighed. "Why did you do that?"



		"I wanted you to eat."



		"I would have eaten later."



		"I didn't want you to wait."



		She tilted her head. "I don't understand you."



		Astero smiled innocently. "What's hard to understand?"



		Rosella stared at him for a moment before her lips turned up into a smile. "Well, thank you." She glanced at the
		blackberry pie in his hands. "I came to give you that. You must be starving."



		He shook his head. "I bought this for you."



		"How about we share it then?" Rosella suggested.



		Astero was about to refuse, but then he looked down at the pie. Back home in the Elessai clan, he ate all the
		blackberry pies he asked for. But now, he would get to eat one with Rosella, just like he always wanted.



		He nodded.



		She smiled. "I'll get us forks."



		When Rosella came back, the two dug into their feast. Rosella looked so happy, smiling the entire time,
		exclaiming how it was the best thing she had ever tasted, and Astero couldn't even begin to explain the feeling
		that burned in his chest. She was his savior, the kindest person to exist in his life. She helped him, fully
		aware of his identity as someone from the ground, and she sacrificed her happiness for it.



		Astero watched her take another bite, and Rosella smiled at him, eyes brighter than he had ever seen them. She
		deserved to be this happy all the time.
