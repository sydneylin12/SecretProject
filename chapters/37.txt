The east wing of the Dorina manor happened to the furthest from the main se=
ctor of the manor, as well as the smallest. The Elessai clan=E2=80=94with a=
ll their servants and workers that Kairo brought=E2=80=94occupied the west =
wing. The Lem and Jourman clans, being smaller in number, both occupied the=
 south wing, closest to the forest. The Dorina clan resided everywhere thro=
ughout the manor, mostly staying in the main sector. And, Josemi supposed, =
the Ozario clan were assigned to stay in the east wing. Josemi could not he=
lp but think the entire north were doing its best to keep the Ozarios exclu=
ded.=20

She hastened through the hallways that appeared much more empty now that wo=
rkers were not putting up decorations or hurriedly delivering food to Dorin=
a clan nobles. A sad, empty feeling crawled its way into her chest. Althoug=
h she had been against forcing Astero to marry someone he did not like, she=
 hoped they would grow to love one another, just like she did with Kairo.=
=20

Josemi sighed. And look how that turned out.

Not a soul lingered in the east wing when Josemi arrived. No servants, no p=
assing nobles. Perhaps the Ozarios did not bring anyone but themselves.=20

Her steps echoed through the corridors, ringing loud in her ears. The walls=
 were royal blue, but they seemed different compared to the other wings of =
the manor. Patches of gray spotted the stone walls, and the brightness of t=
he usual color appeared dim and lifeless.=20

Did the Dorinas hate the Ozarios that much, making them stay in the worst p=
art of their home?=20

The first five room Josemi came across belonged to servants. She awkwardly =
apologized for disturbing them and hurriedly continued down the halls.=20

The sixth room had been empty. So had the seventh. And eighth. And ninth.=
=20

The tenth door was all the way at the end, almost hidden away. It loomed cl=
oser and closer, and soon, Josemi was standing right before it. If this roo=
m did not belong to Lord Ozario, then she feared she would lose all hope of=
 finding him.=20

Josemi knocked hesitantly. Two small taps on the door. Perhaps the knocks w=
ere not loud enough, and she cringed at the thought of having to knock agai=
n.=20

However, like some sort of miracle, the door opened. A woman with wavy blon=
de hair and stony blue eyes appeared in front of her, wearing a light pink =
gown, a strange color to see in the Dorina manor. Many people wore blues mi=
xed with pink, but to see an all-pink dress was uncommon.=20

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice monotone.=20

"Lady Ozario," Josemi acknowledged, attempting to hide her surprise. "Is Lo=
rd Ozario present?"=20

The woman simply stared for a few long moments at Josemi, perhaps trying to=
 figure out why she needed to see her husband. Her piercing blue eyes appea=
red ice cold. Josemi smiled uncomfortably.=20

After what felt like an eternity, Lady Ozario shook her head. "He is away a=
t the moment."=20

"Do you know when he will be back?" Josemi pressed.=20

Lady Ozario shrugged halfheartedly. "Two weeks?"=20

Josemi's heart plummeted. Two more agonizing weeks of waiting, worrying for=
 her son who was in a land of monsters. Two more weeks stressing over wheth=
er or not she would be doing the right thing. Two more weeks in the Dorina =
clan, surrounded by strangers and enemies.=20

"Why do you need to see him?" Lady Ozario asked, a hint of curiosity in her=
 voice.=20

Then, it occurred to her that while Lord Ozario may not be around to answer=
 her questions, Lady Ozario was.=20

"Do you know where my son is?" Josemi blurted out.=20

"What?" Lady Ozario appeared perplexed. "How would I know?"=20

"I =E2=80=94 " Josemi stopped. There was a possibility Lady Ozario knew not=
hing at all about what her husband was scheming. "Apologies, it's just... W=
e've been looking for him =E2=80=94 "

"Do you think my husband would know where he is?"=20

Josemi suddenly felt cold. Perhaps she had offended Lady Ozario. Or perhaps=
 she had given away his plan.=20

Josemi said nothing, and Lady Ozario stared curiously at her before opening=
 her door wider, gesturing inside. "Come in, Lady Elessai."=20

Cautiously, Josemi took a step forward. Bathed in blue like the rest of the=
 rooms in the Dorina clan, the only difference would be the temperature. A =
chilling breeze swept over the room, and Josemi felt for the poor Ozarios f=
orced into this nearly abandoned corner of the manor.=20

Lady Ozario shut the door quietly. She gestured to the armchair by the wind=
ow. "Have a seat," she said, striding towards the chair by the vanity.

Josemi took a seat, patting down the fabric of her chiton in an effort to w=
arm up her legs. It was a warm summer day, so she left her shawl in her roo=
m, but in this room, Josemi rubbed her arms to keep from shivering.=20

Lady Ozario seemed unfazed by the cold. She sat perfectly still, her stony =
features and empty gaze giving her a statue-like appearance.=20

"Where are you from, Lady Ozario?" Josemi could not help but ask.=20

Lady Ozario said nothing for a few moments, studying Josemi through those d=
ark blue eyes. Then, as if she had come to a decision, Lady Ozario turned t=
o face her vanity mirror, picked up a brush, and began brushing her blonde =
waves without a care in the world. "The west," she replied to Josemi's ques=
tion.=20

Although a bit taken aback, Josemi did not dare say anything about Lady Oza=
rio's rudeness in her own room. "Which clan?"=20

"Aewin."=20

Josemi had never met anyone from the Aewin clan, nor had she ever been ther=
e. From what she had heard, the Aewin clan mostly kept to themselves and di=
d not try fostering relations with other clans. She did not even know who t=
he current leader was.=20

"May I know your given name?" Josemi inquired.=20

"Anessia," she replied, her voice soft and buttery, yet completely devoid o=
f emotion. She set the brush down and picked up a charcoal pen. Carefully, =
Anessia Ozario outlined her eyes, her hand steady.=20

Josemi did not recognize the name, although that was to be expected. The on=
ly people from the Aewin clan she had even heard of were Wenma Aewin, the c=
urrent clan leader, and Willem Aewin, famous for being a madman and who was=
 rumored to have been sent to the ground, although most people believe he h=
ad been simply killed in a dispute between the Dorina and Silvora clans.=20

"Anessia... Aewin? Were you from the main family?"=20

She shook her head, continuing to draw around her other eye. "I was an Aewi=
n, but not from the main family."=20

"How long have you been married?"=20

"I was seventeen. Crisanto was eighteen. About fifteen years."=20

Josemi hated being so intrusive, but for the sake of her son, she needed to=
 know as much as possible about the people she chose to get involved with. =
"Were you already with him when the Ozario clan began to decline?"=20

Anessia's hand that had been carefully drawing around her eyes suddenly sto=
pped. Slowly, she set the charcoal pen down and turned to face Josemi, her =
expression remaining statuesque. Her dark blue eyes appeared brighter amids=
t the dark outline. "I was," she replied calmly. "I stayed with him through=
 it all, even though the Ozarios were no longer a reputable clan." Anessia =
sighed, gazing into the mirror. Josemi knew how it felt to marry into a cla=
n where she would be an outsider. The only difference between them was that=
 when she married Kairo, the Elessai were thriving. When Anessia Aewin marr=
ied Crisanto Ozario, the Ozarios had already begun their spiral into declin=
e and despair.=20

"Did you not want to leave?" Josemi asked curiously. "To go back to the Aew=
in clan?"=20

Her eyebrows creased, and she seemed confused. "Why would I leave?"

Seeing the taken aback look on Josemi's face, Anessia explained, her expres=
sion resolute, her bright blue eyes showing no hint of wavering. "I am an O=
zario now. And I had no intention of going back to that family." She turned=
 back to face her mirror, powdering her face. "Crisanto's family treated me=
 better than my own. So of course I would not want to leave."=20

"Was yours an arranged marriage?"=20

Anessia Ozario shook her head. "We met through a friend."=20

An unarranged marriage between clan nobles was extremely rare. To marry for=
 love... Josemi could only dream of such a thing. Perhaps Anessia Ozario's =
marriage into the Ozario clan was not as unlucky as Josemi initially believ=
ed.=20

"I am only answering your questions, Lady Elessai, because my husband has b=
een acting strange." Lady Ozario picked up a small brush, dipped in a tiny =
jar, and applied it to her lips.=20

Josemi's heart jumped, trying to control her expression. "Has he?"=20

Lady Ozario set down the brush and turned to face Josemi, her face donning =
the most extraordinary work of cosmetics she had ever seen. Lips the same s=
hade of pink as her dress, cheeks rosy against her pale skin. Josemi wonder=
ed where she learned such an exquisite art. Through long eyelashes, Lady Oz=
ario's stormy blue eyes narrowed. "I believe you know that. Why else come t=
o find him?"=20

"I did not know he had been acting strange," Josemi assured. "But..."

Anessia Ozario leaned forward, raising a thin blonde eyebrow. "But what?"=
=20

Josemi inhaled, exhaled, hoping she was not making a mistake. "Do you know =
a woman named Willow?"=20

A flicker of surprise sparked in Lady Ozario's eyes. "How do you..." She tr=
ailed off, contemplating.=20

"What is it?" Josemi pressed, eager to know.=20

"I don't understand," Lady Ozario murmured to herself quietly. Looking to J=
osemi, she asked, "How do you know her?"=20

"She... discussed something with me." Josemi did not know if she should go =
into detail. If Lady Ozario knew nothing of their plan, Josemi should not b=
e the one to tell her. "Who is she?"=20

Perhaps Lady Ozario was wondering the exact same thing, for she hesitated. =
After a moment of inner turmoil, she seemed to have come to a decision.=20

"Please excuse me, Lady Elessai." Lady Ozario stood from her seat, looking =
everywhere but at Josemi, clutching her pink skirts. "I have matters to att=
end to."=20

Sighing, Josemi stood as well. Not all answers would come so easily, nor al=
l at once. She would be patient. She would wait until Lord Ozario's return.=
=20

"Apologies for the intrusion," Josemi said as she made her way to the door.=
 "Thank you for discussing this with me, Lady Ozario."=20

Anessia Ozario smiled tightly. It seemed all she wanted was for this conver=
sation to be over. "Of course." She opened the door and gestured to the emp=
ty hallway.=20

Before Josemi stepped through the door completely, she turned back to Lady =
Ozario, eyes pleading. "If anything comes up, please let me know. I am curr=
ently residing in the west wing, but many Elessai servants are around the m=
anor. You can inform one of them if you need to speak with me."=20

Lady Ozario continued to the push the door so that Josemi had no choice but=
 to step into the hallway completely. Avoiding Josemi's eyes, she said, "Go=
od day, Lady Elessai." Then she shut the door, leaving Josemi in the dark, =
empty corridor.
