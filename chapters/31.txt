Ever since talking to Kisani in the village, Kona hadn't seen her for the r=
est of the day. She roamed around, asking about Astero Elessai and coming u=
p with nothing. Afterwards, she went back to the hospital and asked around =
for Kisani. Celeste said she had just gone home for the night and would be =
back in the morning.=20

Feeling a bit more relieved by Celeste's reassurance, Kona laid in her bed =
that night, hopeful to talk more with Kisani the next day.

However, in the middle of the night, Kona heard footsteps outside the door =
to her room in the hospital. She leapt from her bed, grabbed the knife unde=
r her pillow, and ducked behind the bed, waiting anxiously for an intruder,=
 her heart thudding rapidly.=20

The door opened, and in walked Celeste, a gentle smile on her face.

"Stay away," Kona demanded, holding up the knife.=20

Celeste sighed, her eyes turning sad. "Please relax, Kona. You have an untr=
eated cut."=20

Celeste had treated her before, out of the generosity of her heart. Kona di=
d nothing in return for the treatment, and Celeste asked for nothing.=20

Kona lowered the knife, completely forgetting about the strange time of day=
, Celeste's strange melancholic eyes, and the way her hands shifted nervous=
ly at her sides.=20

She chose to trust Celeste.

So Kona nodded. Celeste stepped closer, and closer, stepped around the bed,=
 until she stood in front of Kona, her warm expression filling the Sanu ass=
assin with warmth. During her time on the ground, Kona realized that while =
Lady Willow felt like a stern older sister who did her best to condition Ko=
na into a strong person who could never be beaten, Celeste felt more like a=
 mother who would care for Kona no matter what. When they first met, Kona h=
ad asked why she would care for her. And Celeste had said that Kona was a p=
erson, and she deserved care just like anyone else.=20

Kona trusted her. Looking into those soft, ancient eyes, she felt the needl=
e prick her arm. Then everything went black.=20

When she finally came to, Kona could not move a single inch of her body.=20

Opening her eyes groggily, she observed her surroundings. Darkness enclosed=
 her, the only light being from the flame of a candle from outside the cell=
. The metal bars of a prison cell filled her vision, and stone walls surrou=
nded her on either side. It was cold and silent.=20

Kona had been in a situation like this before. When she made an assassinati=
on attempt on one of the Sanu clan's nobles, they captured and imprisoned h=
er for days. They were actually talking of sending her to the ground, but L=
ady Willow helped her escape just in time. The two of them then left the Sa=
nu clan and traveled throughout the sky together.=20

But now, Lady Willow was too far away to help her.=20

Kona told herself to stop being idiotic. She shouldn't have trusted Celeste=
. She shouldn't have trusted Kisani. She should've known that people from t=
he sky would be treated differently. But Kona really thought that maybe eve=
ryone was wrong about the ground, that there were good people here.=20

An aching sadness built up inside of her. This was it. This was reality. An=
d this was the price she had to pay for believing it could be otherwise.=20

Long chains extended from the walls and wrapped around her wrists, securing=
 her in place. They were extremely tight, a death-like grip on Kona. There =
was no way out of this.=20

Kona did not cry, nor did she feel scared. She was orphan from the streets =
of the Sanu clan. She became a killer to get the things she wanted. She bec=
ame an assassin when she needed the money. Normally, Kona would never have =
offered to do something so kind for Kisani.=20

In just two weeks, this place changed her, and not for the better. Her dign=
ity and pride as a feared name washed away with pretty words and plastic sm=
iles. Perhaps eating with her friends and walking with them through the hos=
pital grounds and lying with Kisani underneath the sky were all illusions K=
ona conjured inside her own head.=20

Perhaps the people on the ground were not monsters, as the stories have alw=
ays told. However, it was true that they hated those from the sky, and a me=
asly friendship would not change centuries of animosity.=20

Besides, that friendship may have been a sham. There was only one person Ko=
na spoke to about the sky.=20

A noise sounded from outside, presumably a door being opened. Footsteps. Mu=
ltiple.=20

Three people walked and stood in front of Kona. Two she didn't recognize. T=
he other was the girl who Kona thought was as beautiful as sunlight. She st=
ood in the darkness, a shameful expression on her face.=20

"I assume this is your doing." Kona's voice came out empty, sounding a mill=
ion miles away from her own ears.=20

Kisani shook her head in disbelief. "I didn't want to."=20

"What did I ever do to you?" Kona genuinely wanted to know.=20

Kisani looked away.=20

"I tried to help you."=20

"I know."=20

"This is because I'm from the sky?"=20

"Do you not understand?" Kisani hissed, stepping closer. Kona could clearly=
 see her eyes now. They were shining with tears. "I lost everything because=
 of my father."=20

Kona scoffed. "Am I your father?"=20

Kisani glared. "You're the same kind. You send anyone you don't want down h=
ere, and no one can go up. My father said it was like paradise up there, an=
d down here, it's hell."=20

"I was taught that anyone who lived on the ground were demons."=20

"What are you trying to say?"=20

Kona shrugged, not saying a word.=20

"You will be kept here for a long time, Kona." Strangely, Kisani seemed rel=
uctant to say these words. "We can't just send you to the sky, unfortunatel=
y. It's not that easy for us."=20

"A long time?" Kona gave her a bitter smile. "That's good. I'll outlive you=
."=20

Kisani sucked in a shaky breath, but before she could do anything, the guar=
ds told her that her time was up, and she needed to leave. Kona watched her=
 walk away, feeling a single moment of pride.=20

Then, the reality of her situation came crashing down, and her breaths bega=
n to quicken. Kona tried to breathe, to gain control of herself. The only w=
ay she could do that was with the sight of blood, preferably her own. But h=
er hands were tied, and Kona could do nothing.=20

Kona shut her eyes, as if the world would wash away.=20

In her mind, she saw the woman who saved her eight years ago. The woman who=
 could not save her now.

Lady Willow. I'm sorry.

<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona trusted her. Looking into those soft, ancient eyes, she felt the needle prick her arm. Then everything went black.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">When she finally came to, Kona could not move a single inch of her body.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Opening her eyes groggily, she observed her surroundings. Darkness enclosed her, the only light being from the flame of a candle from outside the cell. The metal bars of a prison cell filled her vision, and stone walls surrounded her on either side. It was cold and silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona had been in a situation like this before. When she made an assassination attempt on one of the Sanu clan's nobles, they captured and imprisoned her for days. They were actually talking of sending her to the ground, but Lady Willow helped her escape just in time. The two of them then left the Sanu clan and traveled throughout the sky together.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">But now, Lady Willow was too far away to help her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona told herself to stop being idiotic. She shouldn't have trusted Celeste. She shouldn't have trusted Kisani. She should've known that people from the sky would be treated differently. But Kona really thought that maybe everyone was wrong about the ground, that there were good people here.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">An aching sadness built up inside of her. This was it. This was reality. And this was the price she had to pay for believing it could be otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Long chains extended from the walls and wrapped around her wrists, securing her in place. They were extremely tight, a death-like grip on Kona. There was no way out of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona did not cry, nor did she feel scared. She was orphan from the streets of the Sanu clan. She became a killer to get the things she wanted. She became an assassin when she needed the money. Normally, Kona would never have offered to do something so kind for Kisani.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">In just two weeks, this place changed her, and not for the better. Her dignity and pride as a feared name washed away with pretty words and plastic smiles. Perhaps eating with her friends and walking with them through the hospital grounds and lying with Kisani underneath the sky were all illusions Kona conjured inside her own head.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Perhaps the people on the ground were not monsters, as the stories have always told. However, it was true that they hated those from the sky, and a measly friendship would not change centuries of animosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Besides, that friendship may have been a sham. There was only one person Kona spoke to about the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">A noise sounded from outside, presumably a door being opened. Footsteps. Multiple.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Three people walked and stood in front of Kona. Two she didn't recognize. The other was the girl who Kona thought was as beautiful as sunlight. She stood in the darkness, a shameful expression on her face.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I assume this is your doing." Kona's voice came out empty, sounding a million miles away from her own ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani shook her head in disbelief. "I didn't want to."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What did I ever do to you?" Kona genuinely wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani looked away.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I tried to help you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I know."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"This is because I'm from the sky?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Do you not understand?" Kisani hissed, stepping closer. Kona could clearly see her eyes now. They were shining with tears. "I lost everything because of my father."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona scoffed. "Am I your father?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani glared. "You're the same kind. You send anyone you don't want down here, and no one can go up. My father said it was like paradise up there, and down here, it's hell."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I was taught that anyone who lived on the ground were demons."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What are you trying to say?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona shrugged, not saying a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You will be kept here for a long time, Kona." Strangely, Kisani seemed reluctant to say these words. "We can't just send you to the sky, unfortunately. It's not that easy for us."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"A long time?" Kona gave her a bitter smile. "That's good. I'll outlive you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani sucked in a shaky breath, but before she could do anything, the guards told her that her time was up, and she needed to leave. Kona watched her walk away, feeling a single moment of pride.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Then, the reality of her situation came crashing down, and her breaths began to quicken. Kona tried to breathe, to gain control of herself. The only way she could do that was with the sight of blood, preferably her own. But her hands were tied, and Kona could do nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona shut her eyes, as if the world would wash away.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">In her mind, she saw the woman who saved her eight years ago. The woman who could not save her now.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
