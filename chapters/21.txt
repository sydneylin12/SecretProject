She had only been attending jobs with Astero for a few days, but leaving fo=
r a job on her own for the first time without him made Rosella more uneasy =
than she cared to admit. She had grown used to him being by her side. Rosel=
la never had many friends on the ground, and if she did, the friendship did=
 not last long. A part of her, the dark and hopeless part of her, anticipat=
ed the day he would leave. He had a home, a family, a fianc=C3=A9e, and mon=
ey. He had no reason to stay by her side.=20

And yet, she desperately wanted him to. Rosella couldn't remember the last =
time she felt so happy.=20

The walk to the banquet hall wasn't long, but the heat did start to get to =
her. Because it was a formal event, Rosella had to wear a dress that covere=
d her arms and went down to her ankles, and sweat began to build on her ski=
n. She made sure to wear the hat Astero had bought her, which gave her some=
 degree of comfort in his absence.=20

Rosella greeted people she knew as she walked past, which wasn't many. Howe=
ver, she was quite well-known in the village for being willing to take up a=
ny job, no matter what it may be. She was also known for being easy to push=
 around, which was true. Rosella valued money, and she would do whatever it=
 took to acquire it, no matter how little the amount, and no matter the cos=
t to her pride. She learned to throw away useless things like pride a long =
time ago. If her family saw her now, what would they think of her?=20

It had been fifteen years since she had last seen her parents, sixteen year=
s since she had last seen her brother, and probably over twenty years since=
 she had last seen her sister. If she ran into her siblings now, Rosella li=
kely would not be able to recognize them. She could remember her parents fa=
irly well, but Soro Crisanto's face would likely have changed. And it had b=
een too long since Anle Willow's face crossed her memory. But she remembere=
d their smiles and their warmth, which kept her company throughout the year=
s. She imagined them living happily in the Ozario manor, her father still c=
lan leader, Soro Crisanto as the heir, and his wife at his side. Anle Willo=
w would probably still be traveling, but Rosella liked to imagine her retur=
ning home every few months. It gave her comfort thinking they were happy wi=
thout her. She didn't want to be the reason for any unhappiness in their fa=
mily.

It was all right that she be the only one suffering, as long as they were h=
appy.=20

"Rosella!" a man, who she recognized as one of her previous employers, call=
ed out to her. "Going to a job?"=20

She smiled and nodded. "The renovations meeting!"=20

"Next week, I need you to watch my daughter for a day!"=20

"How much will you pay me?"=20

"Does it matter?"=20

Rosella laughed sadly. "I suppose not." She proceeded to walk a bit faster =
to reach her destination.

The banquet hall was quite close to Mr. Hestyn's house. It was the largest =
building in the village, and Rosella has been there many times before to cl=
ean. She hadn't served in a formal event in a long time, and thinking about=
 making a fool of herself in front of respected town leaders made her body =
tingle with nerves. Rosella wished she had Astero's arm to hold on to.=20

Steeling herself, Rosella headed inside the building. The entire banquet ha=
ll covered the first floor, and two marble staircases led up to the second =
floor, where the private rooms and washrooms were located. People milled ab=
out, setting up tables and chairs for the meeting. It was an extremely impo=
rtant event for Onen, a village that hadn't seen proper renovations in a lo=
ng time.=20

"Workers, to the kitchens!" called a voice, and Rosella hurried along with =
the others. "The town leaders will be here in five minutes!"=20

Once inside the kitchen, Rosella put on a white apron over her gray dress, =
took as many plates as she could carry, and scuttled into the banquet hall =
along with the rest of the workers, placing the plates of freshly cooked fo=
od at a seat at each table. Her years of work and serving gave her plenty o=
f experience with balancing multiple plates along her arms, and she noticed=
 the stares of horror and fascination from the others.=20

"As expected," praised one of the women passing by her.=20

Rosella smiled in response. She prided herself on the quality and efficienc=
y of her work, and it often earned her bonus pay, which was the real goal. =
She noticed the people in charge eyeing her with amazement, and that gave h=
er encouragement.=20

After all the tables were set, the multitude of workers took their places a=
t the sides of the room, and the leaders from the town made their entrance.=
=20

Most of them were men in fancy tunics, and some even wore cravats just to s=
how that they could. The clothing was nothing compared to the wardrobe worn=
 by clan members up in the sky, but they were some of the nicest she had se=
en on the ground thus far.=20

The men strode into the room, and the air immediately grew quiet, allowing =
more room for the size of their presence. This village saw them as saviors =
who would finally build better houses, import quality food, and provide mor=
e money for entertainment.=20

Rosella didn't particularly care. Her mind was focused on becoming the best=
 server, hopefully obtaining a bonus reward, and hopefully seeking more job=
 opportunities, perhaps from one of these rich men.=20

They all took their seats at the various tables and conversed with one anot=
her while eating. Rosella took deep, steady breaths, trying not to pass out=
 from the heat, and she noticed a lot of the other servants wiping sweat of=
f their foreheads or swaying on their feet. She could not afford to pass ou=
t. The payment for this job was worth more than her life.=20

Although, she said that about every job.=20

Suddenly, her eyes locked on to a water glass belonging to one of the men t=
hat was nearing empty. Before any of the other servants could take action, =
Rosella immediately headed to the refreshments table, picked up one of the =
jugs of water, and glided over to that table.=20

She approached the man from behind. "More water, sir?" Rosella asked, plast=
ering a smile on her face.=20

He turned around in his chair to look at her, and his previously neutral fa=
ce turned wide-eyed with shock. "You," he breathed.=20

Rosella was taken aback. "I'm =E2=80=94 I'm sorry?"=20

He continued to stare at her.=20

She racked her brain for where and when she could have possibly met this ma=
n before. He didn't look at all familiar to her. He looked twice her age, a=
nd he was clearly rich. They obviously didn't run in the same circles. Perh=
aps he had mistaken her for someone else.

Deciding to ignore the awkward turn of events, Rosella reached around him a=
nd filled up his water glass. All his staring made her uncomfortable, and s=
he wanted to leave as soon as possible.=20

"Mine too, miss," said another man at the table, and Rosella immediately hu=
rried over to him. However, she could feel the man's eyes tracking her ever=
y move, and despite the heat, it made her blood run cold.=20

Rosella quickly returned to the refreshments table and set the water jug do=
wn. Then, she took her place by the wall once again, ignoring the intense p=
ounding of her heart. The way the man looked at her made her more nervous t=
han she cared to admit.=20

Where could they have possibly met? Rosella's memory truly wasn't the best,=
 and she had met many people over the years. Most faces made no impression =
on her. But apparently, she was important enough for him to remember.=20

She couldn't get the nervous feeling out of her head, and for the rest of t=
he banquet meeting, Rosella did not refresh anyone else's beverage or pick =
up any empty plates. She stayed by the wall as the time passed by, having g=
iven up on getting any sort of bonus money. All Rosella wanted was to leave=
 as soon as possible.

When the meeting finally ended after an hour, Rosella quickly headed into t=
he kitchen to remove her apron. Then, she went upstairs to the washroom, sp=
lashing water on her face. She needed to calm down. Rosella closed her eyes=
 and took deep breaths. Her skin was heating up, and she felt sick. Rosella=
 nearly laughed at the image of her and Astero lying sick on the floor of h=
is bedroom while Jayda complained about having to cook dinner herself.=20

However, when another person entered the washroom, Rosella felt nothing but=
 horror.=20

It was him.=20

"It is you, isn't it." His voice seemed almost giddy, and a horrifying smil=
e spread across his face.=20

Rosella was rooted in place. She felt paralyzed.=20

"What was your name again?" he asked, stepping closer.=20

She shook her head frantically. "I don't think we've met before."=20

His expression immediately darkened. "You don't remember me?"=20

"You must be mistaken =E2=80=94 "

"After all the money I gave you?" His dark blue eyes turned murderous. "Aft=
er everything we did together?"=20

Her breaths came out quicker, and she squeezed her hands together to stop t=
hem from trembling. "I'm sorry," she whispered, looking down at his feet. H=
is face terrified her. "I don't remember you."=20

He stepped closer, close enough that his chest was nearly pressed up agains=
t her face, and suddenly, a memory came to her mind. A room. A bed. Hands o=
n her wrists. Her face obscured by a man's chest, so close she could barely=
 breathe.=20

She did know him. Just a few years ago, Rosella had sold her body to a man =
willing to pay her large sums every night she spent with him. She had done =
it before and hardly ran into problems. Most of the men were lonely, in nee=
d of companionship, and she gave it to them in exchange for money. Some wer=
e rough with her, but they had never gone too far. However, there was one m=
an who refused to listen to her. No matter how much she said she didn't lik=
e something, he would never stop. Rosella let this happen, for she believed=
 the money was worth it.=20

Until the night he snapped her wrist and still didn't stop, no matter how m=
uch she cried.=20

Rosella left that town with the most money she had ever made, as well as a =
broken wrist. And since then, she refused to do that kind of work again.=20

The man in front of her forcibly grabbed her chin and tilted her head up so=
 she couldn't look away. He peered down at her, eyes blazing. "Then I will =
make you remember."=20

Rosella took a step back, but he simply took a step forward.=20

"You left me," he accused angrily. "I had money to give, and you left anywa=
y!"=20

She swallowed hard. Rosella glanced at the doorway, and the most obvious so=
lution finally came to mind. "Help!" she cried. "Help! Help =E2=80=94 !"=20

The man covered her mouth and backed her all the way up against the wall. "=
Quiet," he hissed. "You'll regret that."=20

Think, Rosella. Think.

She tried to calm down by looking around. Wash buckets. Water tubs. Drown h=
im? She wasn't strong enough to hold him down. Perhaps she could splash wat=
er in his face, but that would hardly even startle him.=20

Think, Rosella.

Her eyes fixed upon the windowsill. A ceramic vase was placed there, holdin=
g white orchids and lilies. The sun shown down on them, illuminating their =
beauty.=20

Rosella turned back to the man. As swiftly as possible, Rosella brought up =
her knee right between his legs.=20

The man cried out and let her go, falling to the ground like a broken doll.=
=20

Rosella grabbed the vase and, in one fell swoop, smashed it against his hea=
d.=20

He slumped over, unconscious.=20

Rosella stepped back with trembling hands. Not a single thought ran through=
 her head.=20

She tried running for the door, but she tripped over his lifeless body, cra=
shing to the ground next to him. Her own arms braced the fall, but she fell=
 right on top of the vase shards. Covered in cuts with sleeves soaked in bl=
ood, Rosella picked herself back up and stumbled out the door.=20

Standing just outside were two people. They startled as Rosella opened the =
door, but she didn't have time to think about them, or what the scene looke=
d like to bystanders. All she needed to do was leave.=20

Rosella descended the stairs and flew out the main entrance. Not even notic=
ing the heat, Rosella ran and ran through the village, hugging her bleeding=
 arms close to her chest.=20

A wave of tiredness hit her so suddenly she nearly collapsed in the middle =
of the path. Rosella cut through the middle of two houses and hobbled over =
to the white wooden fence that cut off the village from the meadow and fore=
st. It provided some protection from the sun, and she leaned against it, he=
r legs giving out until she was sitting on the ground. Rosella closed her e=
yes, and before the darkness took her, she remembered that she had left the=
 hat Astero gave her back at the banquet hall.

sella more uneasy than she cared to admit. She had grown used to him being =
by her side. Rosella never had many friends on the ground, and if she did, =
the friendship did not last long. A part of her, the dark and hopeless part=
 of her, anticipated the day he would leave. He had a home, a family, a fia=
nc=C3=A9e, and money. He had no reason to stay by her side.&nbsp;</p>

nquet hall wasn't long, but the heat did start to get to her. Because it wa=
s a formal event, Rosella had to wear a dress that covered her arms and wen=
t down to her ankles, and sweat began to build on her skin. She made sure t=

 in his absence.&nbsp;</p>

ople she knew as she walked past, which wasn't many. However, she was quite=
 well-known in the village for being willing to take up any job, no matter =
what it may be. She was also known for being easy to push around, which was=
 true. Rosella valued money, and she would do whatever it took to acquire i=
t, no matter how little the amount, and no matter the cost to her pride. Sh=
e learned to throw away useless things like pride a long time ago. If her f=

n years since she had last seen her parents, sixteen years since she had la=
st seen her brother, and probably over twenty years since she had last seen=
 her sister. If she ran into her siblings now, Rosella likely would not be =
able to recognize them. She could remember her parents fairly well, but Sor=
o Crisanto's face would likely have changed. And it had been too long since=
 Anle Willow's face crossed her memory. But she remembered their smiles and=
 their warmth, which kept her company throughout the years. She imagined th=
em living happily in the Ozario manor, her father still clan leader, Soro C=
risanto as the heir, and his wife at his side. Anle Willow would probably s=
till be traveling, but Rosella liked to imagine her returning home every fe=
w months. It gave her comfort thinking they were happy without her. She did=
n't want to be the reason for any unhappiness in their family.</p>

Rosella headed inside the building. The entire banquet hall covered the fir=

listen to her. No matter how much she said she didn't like something, he wo=
