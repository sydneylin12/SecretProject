The only thing about the Fen clan manor Astero didn't particularly like was his bed. It was smaller than the one
back home, and much less comfortable, with fewer cushions and blankets. However, the room was beautiful.
Everything was lower to the ground: lower tables, chairs, windows. In the washroom, candles illuminated the
small space. Astero missed the flowers that decorated the washroom back home, but the candles were indeed
enchanting.



After reuniting with her siblings, Astero and his mother were led by servants to their own rooms. Later, they
would meet with the clan leader, Raigo Fen, Astero's grandfather.



He was admiring the decorations in his room when a knock sounded at the door.



"Come in," he called, and his mother entered.



"Do you like the room?" she asked, walking over to sit on one of the low benches at the dining table.



He nodded, moving to sit down across from her. "Are we going to visit grandfather?"



"He is busy at the moment," she replied, sounding a bit disappointed. "We will have dinner with him later."



"What are we doing until then?"



"I will be visiting some old friends. I've asked Anji and Luxian to show you around the training grounds."



"Where they practice martial arts?"



"Yes, specifically hand-to-hand combat."



Astero felt a wave of excitement.



"Luxian leads the army, and Anji is a formidable fighter," explained his mother, pouring a steaming cup of tea
for herself. He hadn't even realized there was tea. "They are willing to train you, if you'd like."



"I'll probably embarrass myself."



She laughed. "Probably."



Astero feigned hurt. "Wow, mother. You don't think I'll be a natural?"



"Sorry, sorry," she amended, clearing her throat. "I meant, I believe in you wholeheartedly and have no doubt
you'll be a prodigy."



"Now you're just lying," he mumbled.



And, as it turned out, Astero was indeed the opposite of a prodigy.



As Auntie Anji managed to knock him to the ground for the hundredth time, Astero heard Uncle Luxian snicker.



"Don't worry, Astero," he said lightly. "It's only been an hour."



He stayed on the ground, arms and legs splayed out, taking shallow breaths. "I give up," he wheezed.



"Oh, come on." Auntie Anji grabbed his arm, hauling him to his feet. "I was going easy."



"Please tell me you weren't," he begged.



"I wish I could, dear nephew."



Aster groaned.



Although, he found it strangely easy to talk and laugh with them. Auntie Anji was just eighteen years old, and
Uncle Luxian was twenty. They joked and made fun of him as if they had known each other for a long time, and
Astero felt grateful. In the Elessai clan, people treated him with the utmost respect, always wanting to get on
his good side. Even his distant cousins and relatives of his father did not dare anger him. However, in the Fen
clan, they treated him like family.



"Oh, there he is," Uncle Luxian said suddenly, looking at someone coming towards them. "The prodigy himself."



Astero turned to look. Walking towards them was a young boy. His face was a blank slate, showing no sign of
emotion. His eyes were thin and cat-like, almost frightening. He wore Fen clan red, but his robes were designed
with black swirls. He looked younger than Astero, and quite a bit smaller, but much more intimidating.



When the boy arrived, he bowed his head. "Young Lady Fen. Commander Fen."



"Here to train, Xen?" Auntie Anji asked.



He nodded. "I will not disturb you."



"Actually, this is perfect," said Uncle Luxian, putting an arm around Astero. "Would you like to train my
nephew?"



The boy, Xen, stared at him, completely emotionless. Astero felt as if he were staring directly into his soul.
"Nephew?"



"Josemi Mie's son," he replied, grinning. "I'm sure he'll learn a lot from you, the rising star of the Fen
clan."



Xen's face remained passive, but he nodded. "Very well, Commander Fen."



"Wonderful!" He patted Astero's shoulder. "Xen is only thirteen, but he's very talented."



Astero chuckled nervously. "Great."



Xen stepped forward towards Astero, hands behind his back. "Assume a fighting stance."



He did as he was told.



Then, Xen turned to his auntie and uncle, and with the most deadpan expression ever, said, "I'm afraid he's
hopeless."



It was silent for a moment before Auntie Anji and Uncle Luxian burst out laughing.



Astero blanched. He had not been expecting that. "I - I mean I know, but - "



Then, he saw the ghost of a smile on the boy's face. Xen bowed again. "Forgive me, Young Lord Elessai."



"You know who I am?"



"Of course," he replied. "I am aware of the existence of Lady Elessai's son."



"Here, let's try something else," suggested Uncle Luxian. "Why don't we — "



"Commander Fen!" shouted a voice from across the courtyard. "Young Lord Fen requires your assistance."



He sighed. "Better go see what Sa wants."



"I'll come too," said Auntie Anji. She turned to look at Xen and Astero. "Practice until we come back."



"Yes, Young Lady Fen," replied Xen.



"Oh, and Astero," Auntie Anji called back as she walked away with Uncle Luxian, "do you want to meet your baby
cousin later?"



"Of course!" he exclaimed.



She smiled. "Then train hard!"



Then, she and Uncle Luxian disappeared from view, leaving Astero and Xen standing in the middle of the
courtyard.



Astero had no idea what to say to him. Xen was around his age, and he hoped to become his friend, but Astero
didn't know how to read him.



"Are you a Fen?" he decided to ask.



Xen nodded. "Yes, Young Lord Elessai. My great grandmother was the second cousin of Weixia Fen's husband."



Astero had no idea what that meant, but he said, "So... we're distant cousins, then?"



"Perhaps, Young Lord Elessai."



"Ah, you don't have to call me that." Astero had enough of that back home. "Just call me Astero."



"I do not dare."



"Why not?"



Xen looked surprised, likely because he had never heard someone ask 'why' before. "Are you sure?" he whispered,
looking around suspiciously.



Astero laughed awkwardly. "Yes, I'm sure."



"But you are older than me."



"And?"



"It would be disrespectful."



"Then... how about Sa?" Sa was used in the Fen clan to address an older brother.



Xen seemed to consider it. "Very well. I shall address you as Sa."



"Are there a lot of young people in the army?" Astero asked.



"Yes, many train since age five."



Age five? By age five, Astero could barely speak, although that was likely because no one ever spoke to him.



"However, few are as good as I am," said Xen with a straight face.



"...Good for you?"



"Indeed."



"Do you have a lot of friends here?"



"Not at all."



Astero felt bad that he presumed that. "What do you do besides train?"



Xen tilted his head in confusion. "What else would I do?"



He should've figured.



Astero was too tired to keep training. He said, "Well, I'm going to walk around the manor, if that's okay. You
can... do what you came here to do."



Astero started to walk away, but it wasn't long before he heard footsteps behind him. He turned around and
sighed. "Why are you following me?"



"Since we became friends," he said, expressionless and emotionless, "I will show you around the manor."



The boy was strange. His intimidating appearance and his semi-friendly, clueless nature did not line up.
However, Astero had wanted to meet people his age in the Fen clan. So he asked, "Where should we go then?"



Xen led them across the courtyard and through the many pathways around the manor, passing by many servants and
soldiers walking about. They were all dressed mostly in red, though the color was less bold than that of the
main family.



As they walked across one of the bridges, Astero spotted boats along the water. People were fishing, swimming,
and leisurely riding the current. It was wintertime, but it was still warm here. It seemed simpler here, less
focused on drive and innovation. The people looked relaxed and content, and Astero wished he could feel that way
at home. In the Elessai clan, he only had his mother and father. In the Fen clan, he had aunties and uncles,
cousins, a grandfather, and even Xen. He felt comfort in a way he hadn't before.



Well, not exactly. The first time he had ever felt that way was when he met Rosella Ozario. There was an ache in
his chest that lit up whenever he thought of her, and the guilt he carried with him weighed heavy on his
shoulders. He thought of her every day, and it never got easier. He longed to see her again. If only he had a
way to descend the stairway without alerting anyone. However, over the years, he learned the rotation of the
guards, and it would be nearly impossible to descend without any of them noticing. Astero had no idea how he got
so lucky in ascending the stairway.



Before he knew it, Astero realized Xen had led him all the way back to the center building where the main family
stayed. They opened the sliding wooden doors and entered.



The seat of Raigo Fen sat atop a dais, with a low table placed in front of it. Below the dais, rows and rows of
tables were placed along the sides, with cushions as their seats. A long red pathway led up to the clan leader's
elevated place.



The walls were painted mahogany, with decorative golden suns, moons, flowers, and animals. Astero marveled at
their beauty.



"Are we allowed to be in here?" he whispered to Xen.



The boy nodded. "Hopefully."



Astero balked. "Hopefully?"



There was that ghost of a smile on Xen's face again. "You are his grandson. I'm sure Lord Fen will be lenient."



"I can't tell if you're serious or not."



"I am always serious."



"Oh, I'm sure."



Xen headed towards a hall towards the back of the room, and Astero had no choice but to follow him. Behind a set
of opened sliding doors was a room, and inside stood Uncle Zhilin, Uncle Luxian, Auntie Anji, and few other
people he didn't recognize.



"Xen, we're definitely not allowed here," Astero whispered, tugging on his sleeve.



"Of course not," he whispered back, trying his best to peek from behind the doors.



Astero gave up trying to dissuade him. "Okay, well I'm going — "



"The needle works, then?" Uncle Luxian's voice, coming from inside the room, was filled with awe and wonder.



"It is still a work in progress," said Uncle Zhilin, his voice soft. "Depending on the thickness of skin at the
neck, it may not work at all."



"Can't they just be pricked in some other place?" Auntie Anji asked.



"It will only work on the neck."



"And once they're paralyzed, they won't just collapse on the ground?"



"They will be stuck in the exact position they were pricked in."



"Amazing," Auntie Anji breathed. "Sasa, you're a genius!"



"It wasn't just me," he replied, although his voice sounded sheepish. "Everyone worked hard on this. Thank you
all."



Xen suddenly grabbed Astero's wrist and pulled them away from the room, back to the main room, and through the
doors leading outside.



Astero breathed heavily. He had been worried they would be found out, but he was also curious what they were
working on.



"I have seen them working on it before," said Xen in a hushed voice. His eyes looked wondrous. "Young Lord Fen
has been leading the project for a few months now."



"What is it?" Astero asked. "A special needle?"



"A paralysis needle," he replied. "The Fen is at war with the Wonali and Sanu clans in the west. This is our
secret weapon." It was the most expression Astero had seen on Xen's face. He seemed excited, almost giddy.



"How are they going to use it?" he asked curiously.



Xen shrugged. "Probably for infiltration. Or torture."



"Can it actually do what they said?"



He nodded. "I have seen them experimenting on a standing person. He remained paralyzed and standing for one
minute."



Astero had never been curious about inventions before. In the Elessai clan, there was a new one every day.
However, this paralysis needle seemed to be exactly what he needed.



He would descend the stairway and search for Rosella. The ground was vast, and he had no idea where she could
be, but that didn't matter. He would find a way to save her.
