		When Rosella opened her eyes, the sun was right above her. She sat up, and the scent of flowers overwhelmed her.
		It took a moment to realize she was outside, and then she heard footsteps running towards her.



		"Anle!" exclaimed the boy. In his hands, he held an abundance of berries. "I found food."



		He seemed much livelier now than before, and he talked more too. Perhaps he had been scared the whole time that
		Rosella would have turned him in. She felt relieved that he trusted her now.



		As they ate the berries together, this time, it was the boy explaining to her what kinds they were. She had
		never gone berry picking before, and most of the food given to her was served by cooks. She had no knowledge of
		different foods, for her parents always said she needn't had to.



		"These ones are elderberries," he said. "And these are huckleberries. Blackberries are my favorite."



		"Have you tried blackberry pie?" Rosella asked, popping one into her mouth.



		He shook his head. "They had some in the bakery, but I didn't have money."



		"I'll have one made for you," Rosella promised.



		That morning, the two enjoyed each other's company under the morning sun. And Rosella knew that she could not go
		back on her words to this boy. She promised to help him. She promised to keep him safe. She promised to let him
		try all the blackberry dishes he wanted. She promised to teach him more about flowers and stars. No matter what
		happened, Rosella would keep her promises.



		Throughout the rest of the day, Rosella spent most of her time buying him new clothes at the nearest town which
		was nearly an hour's walk. The boy had been hesitant to be separated from her, but she reassured him she'd be
		back by nightfall. She bought him a new pair of trousers, as well as a white shirt. Rosella also bought him
		shoes, soap, and a pair of scissors for his hair. As she passed by a bakery, she bought three loaves of bread.



		When she arrived back at the meadow, the boy was sitting in the middle of the field. In his hand, he clutched
		the rose and the aster Rosella had given him. She saw him wipe at his face, and she wondered if he'd been
		crying.



		"I'm back!" Rosella announced, strolling up to him.



		Immediately, he stood up and ran to her, and in his eyes, Rosella saw relief.



		"You didn't think I'd leave you, did you?" Rosella placed a hand on his shoulder and looked into his eyes.



		The boy faced the ground, and all he did was shrug.



		Rosella reached into her bag and pulled out a loaf of bread. "Your dinner. I'm sorry, they did not have
		blackberry pie this time."



		"It's okay," he said in his soft voice. "Thank you."



		"When you're done, we're going to find a lake nearby to wash you. I bought you new clothes."



		"Okay, Anle," he said, mouth full of bread.



		She got out her own loaf, and the third one she gave to him.



		After they finished their dinner, the two walked through the forest in search of a body of water. Instead of a
		lake, they came across a river.



		"Can you wash yourself?" Rosella asked.



		He nodded. She gave him the bar of soap and left him to bathe in the water, going to another area of the river
		to wash his old clothes.



		After a while, she heard him get out of the water and put on the new clothes she bought for him. "I'm done,
		Anle," the boy called.



		Rosella looked up and saw him clearly for the first time. His skin was lighter than her own, and it was only
		hard to tell due to the amount of dirt and grime all over him. His dark eyes were wide, and his black hair hung
		damp around his face.



		"Let's cut your hair," Rosella said, walking over and sitting him down on a large rock. She took out the pair of
		scissors and cut his hair short. He should be unrecognizable now. The guard had not seen his face, and there
		were plenty of orphans living in these towns. He could live safely.



		"Perfect." She ruffled his now short hair. "Now, let's - "



		Before she could finish, the sound of distant footsteps caught her attention. They were headed upstream towards
		her and the boy.



		She knew he heard it too, for his eyes turned panicked.



		It would take too much time to gather all their things and run, much less cover their tracks. The guards would
		simply chase after them until they could run no longer. Rosella looked at the boy who seemed lost and
		frightened. She took his hand in her own and said, "Don't be scared, okay? I need you to run away from here.
		Don't follow the river, go away from it. Do you understand?"



		He nodded determinedly.



		"Good. Just try and get out of the forest. Make your way to a town. No one knows who you are. You'll be fine."



		"What about you?"



		"I'll stay and distract them."



		"You're not coming with me?"



		"It'll be safer this way," she reassured. "Don't tell anyone you're from the ground. I'll see you again soon,
		okay?



		The boy nodded again. Then, he turned and ran away from the river, away from Rosella. She watched until his
		figure retreated before standing up and patting down her dress. The guards arrived just a few seconds after he
		left.



		"Rosella Ozario," one of the guards said. "You are charged with harboring a fugitive from the ground. We need
		you to come with us."



		She nodded. "Very well."



		"Where is the fugitive?"



		"I don't know."



		"How can you not know?" demanded a different guard. He was the one who she and the boy escaped from.



		"He is long gone," replied Rosella with ease.



		The guards took her by the shoulder and forced her to walk forward. She did not feel scared. All she felt was
		relief that the boy managed to escape.



		They walked all the way to the edge of the forest, where horses awaited. Rosella and the guards rode back in the
		direction of the Ozario clan manor.



		When she entered the gates, her mother and father awaited her. She jumped into their arms, and they scolded her
		for going missing for two days, but they could never stay mad at her for long.



		However, when she looked behind them, there awaited the council of the northern sky. The leaders of each of the
		five clans sat at the long table inside the main room. They stared at her, eyes beady and judging.



		Rosella wanted to sit with her parents at the head of the table, but she was forced to stand with the guards.
		Strangely enough, she still felt no fear. She gazed out at all these faces, chin up high.



		The head of the Dorina clan spoke. She was an old woman, with hair as white as snow and a look sterner than
		anything Rosella had seen before. "Miss Ozario, are you aware of what you've done?"



		Rosella nodded. She saw her parents looking at her with worry, but there was nothing they could do to help her.



		"You have brought in a fugitive from the ground," explained Kalwen Dorina, as if Rosella didn't know. "What do
		you think your punishment should be?"



		"I will take whatever punishment the council sees fit," replied Rosella.



		"She's just a child!" cried her mother. "She didn't know what she was doing."



		"She is thirteen years old, I'm sure she knew exactly what she was doing," said the head of the Lem clan.
		"Unless the child coerced her into helping in some way."



		"I agree that she is young and naive." Safiro Jourman spoke up. "As long as she tells us where the child is, she
		should be granted mercy."



		"Rosella," said her father. He looked at her with pleading eyes. "Tell us what the child looks like. Where are
		they hiding?"



		Rosella knew she would be granted mercy if she told them. After all, the Ozario clan was known to be loyal and
		powerful. No one would want to anger them by insisting their youngest daughter be banished to the ground. And
		yet, she remembered the boy's wondrous eyes as he looked to the stars. She remembered his smiling face when he
		gazed at the flower field. He was so happy, and Rosella promised that he would be safe.



		He was only eight years old. She was his Anle. It was her duty to take care of him.



		So she said, "I don't know. But even if I did, I would not say."



		Angered whispers broke out amongst the clan leaders, and she saw her mother bury her face in her hands.



		I'm sorry, mother. Father. But I made a promise to him. I must keep it.



		"No one has any idea what the child looks like," said Kairo Elessai. He was a domineering man with an
		intimidating glare. "There is no point to this if she is unwilling to say anything. The only person to punish is
		her."



		"I say she should be banished." Kalwen Dorina did not even look at Rosella. The Ozario and Dorina clans were not
		very friendly with one another. "Anyone else agree?"



		"I do," said Yanni Lem.



		"As do I," said Kairo Elessai.



		Safiro Jourman sighed. "Well, that is the majority vote. I'm sorry, Darius."



		Rosella's father looked as if he was in pain. But he said, "Very well then."



		She heard her mother cry out. But Rosella could no longer see them. The guards had turned her around and walked
		her out the doors. They traveled by horseback all the day to the stairway of the western sky. They were afraid
		her parents would attempt to sneak her back in, as the stairway of the northern sky was in Ozario clan
		territory.



		For days and nights, Rosella traveled with the guards. These guards did not belong to any one clan. They guarded
		the stairways and managed their own system of authority. None of them spoke to her.



		She did not bathe or change her clothes, nor could she brush her hair. Her pink and white dress looked muddy and
		stained. Her dark brown hair was too tangled to comb with her fingers. She was used to the luxury that came with
		being the daughter of a clan leader. Now, all of that was gone.



		Rosella wondered why she did not feel more heartbroken. She would never see her family again. She was going to
		be sent to the ground with nothing. She would have to build a new life for herself. And yet, Rosella felt
		content. Perhaps she knew that this was her fate the second she took that boy's hand.



		She hoped he was safe.



		Weeks passed when they finally reached the stairway of the western sky. It was past an empty patch of land. Two
		guards went with her, and they walked together to the silver staircase.



		The guards did not say a word to her. As Rosella looked down and saw the endless spirals, she finally felt the
		need to cry.



		Rosella took a step forward and slowly began her descent to the ground. She felt tears falling down her cheeks,
		but she paid them no mind. One step at a time, Rosella continued down the endless stairway. Her eyes looked down
		the whole time, out of fear she might lose her footing. Hours seemed to pass before the ground finally came in
		sight.



		And then, she took her first step off the stairs. What surrounded her were rocks and caverns. She was somewhere
		in the mountains.



		For the first time, Rosella felt lost. She would have to find her way out of this place, and then she'd have to
		look for a town. From there, her new life would begin.



		Rosella looked up to the sky, at the home she once lived in. She wished for her parents to be happy. She wished
		for her older brother and sister to keep them company, as she could no longer do so. And lastly, she wished for
		the boy to create a life for himself up there, where he could see the stars every night.
