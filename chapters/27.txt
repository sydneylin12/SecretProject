Before the sun could show itself through the windows, Rosella forced hersel=
f to wake up. As quietly as possible, she slipped out of bed and began to p=
ack her things.=20

In a large cloth bag, Rosella placed all her necessities, which wasn't much=
. A hair comb, a shawl, all the money she had, two spare dresses. She decid=
ed to wear the one Astero gave her, as it would be something to remember hi=
m by.=20

She would leave before he woke, before he could leave behind his life for h=
er.=20

Rosella held the necklace he gave her, wondering if she should take it with=
 her or leave it. It was so beautiful, a rare pink gem. It would be worth a=
 fortune, but Rosella could never bring herself to sell it. She promised to=
 make enough money to pay Astero back, but it would take years.=20

Perhaps she should leave it for him to sell to get the money back. Rosella =
decided to leave it on the kitchen counter for him to find. She wanted desp=
erately to wear it, to feel like an Ozario again, but she did not have the =
right to. Astero would find it. And hopefully, he would not come after her.=
=20

Quietly, Rosella opened the door and slipped outside her room, hoping Aster=
o was still sound asleep. The sun hadn't risen, and Astero rarely woke up b=
efore she did, so she was confident she could make her escape.=20

However, when she descended the stairs, Astero was sitting at the kitchen t=
able, wide awake, and judging by his cloak and packed bag, ready to go.=20

He smiled, and Rosella groaned.=20

"You don't seem happy to see me," he noted, standing up.=20

"I was hoping not to," she grumbled.=20

"I thought you might do something like this." Astero reached over and took =
her bag as well. "Ready to go?"=20

Looking at his eyes that showed absolutely no hesitation, at that moment, R=
osella decided to give up. No matter what she tried, he seemed to know her =
too well. And it wasn't like she didn't want him to come along.=20

"I just want you to be sure about this," she said, looking into his dark ey=
es, trying to see any signs of doubt or reluctance.=20

But she saw none.=20

His face broke out into the brightest smile, and she couldn't help but smil=
e back. Astero held out his hand. "Let's go?"=20

Rather than taking it, Rosella handed him the necklace. He looked down at i=
t, confused. For a moment, Rosella thought he might take it back. It was hi=
s, after all. However, Astero held both ends of it and placed it around her=
 neck. She moved her hair aside for easier access, and the coldness of his =
fingers brushed against her skin, causing her to shiver involuntarily. Once=
 the clasp was on, he stepped back, and she turned around to face him.=20

Somehow, he looked happier than before. "It looks good on you. The dress, t=
oo."=20

She reached for his hand and held it in her own, interlocking their fingers=
. His hand was warm and comforting. Rosella had spent years looking out for=
 herself. She had always been alone, and while it felt strange to have some=
one to rely on, it also felt like bliss.=20

It would take them a week of nonstop traveling to get to the east. Rosella =
had never been there, not even in the sky. She heard the weather was even w=
armer than the north in the summer, which made Rosella worried, for the hea=
t was already enough in Onen. However, Astero said his mother was from the =
east, so the heat didn't bother him as much, as he seemed used to it. It wo=
uld be nice to have him at her side there. =20

The two of them walked along the village. It was early in the day, the sun =
barely showing itself amidst the land in the sky. This small village where =
Rosella had lived for just a few months began to feel like home. And now, b=
ecause of her past mistakes, she would be leaving it behind.=20

"Are you all right?" Astero asked as they strolled through the streets, his=
 eyes full of concern.

Rosella sighed. "I just wonder if this same thing will happen in the east. =
And then it will keep happening until everyone in the whole world hates me,=
 and I'll have nowhere left to go."=20

"If that happens, I will stay by your side," Astero assured, squeezing her =
hand tighter.=20

It was almost amusing how he didn't deny that was a possibility.=20

"Do you know any nice places in the east?" Rosella asked.=20

Astero nearly jumped, as if he wasn't expecting this question. He laughed, =
almost uncomfortably. "Uh... would I?"=20

Rosella turned to look at him in confusion. "You said your mother was from =
there, and you had been there?"=20

His eyes widened for a split second, but then he forcefully laughed. "Right=
! No, yes, I remember saying that, of course."=20

"Of course."=20

"Yes!" He continued to laugh, and Rosella began to grow concerned. "I'm sor=
ry, my memory is not the best."=20

"Clearly."=20

He cleared his throat awkwardly. "It has been a long time since I've been t=
here. I don't remember the place very well."=20

Rosella smiled softly at him. "Then it will be an adventure for the both of=
 us."=20

Hand in hand, the pair made their way to the outskirts of the village, the =
sun slowly rising in the sky. Rosella turned back one last time. This was t=
he place she lived the longest. Because it was in the north, she even felt =
close to her old home. This was where she finally found a woman to stay wit=
h, in a home she finally felt safe in. It was where she met Astero.=20

She looked at him now, dressed as shabbily as her, his dark hair messier th=
an when she had first seen him. There was a hint of fatigue in his features=
, likely from the hours of working, as well as his recent sickness. It migh=
t have just been her imagination, but he also looked thinner already. Dark =
circles under his eyes showed he had not been sleeping well, perhaps from t=
he uncomfortable mat he had been sleeping on. And yet, those eyes, so beaut=
iful and bright, never changed.=20

Rosella wondered if he would think any different of her if he found out abo=
ut her past. If he left, she would most likely be fine. She had spent so ma=
ny years looking after herself, after all. But strangely enough, Rosella di=
d not want to imagine what a future without him would be like. Perhaps she =
had grown attached.=20

And that was never a good thing.=20

"We can buy horses on the way there," he said as they walked along the road=
. "I'll pay, of course."=20

She rolled her eyes, knowing she couldn't change his mind to just walk the =
whole way. It was what she would have done had she been alone.=20

"Do you need anything else?" Astero asked. "More clothes?"=20

Rosella shook her head. "I just want breakfast."=20

"Here." Astero reached into one of his sacks and pulled out something wrapp=
ed in paper. He handed it to her, and Rosella took it from him skeptically.=
=20

"What is this?" she asked, inspecting it.=20

"Breakfast!" he replied cheerfully.=20

She raised an eyebrow questioningly, but nevertheless, Rosella slowly unwra=
pped the paper.=20

It was something akin to an egg tart, but Rosella couldn't be sure.=20

"Where... did you get this?" she asked cautiously.=20

He smiled so brightly, Rosella almost melted. "I made it!"=20

Her eyes widened. She looked down at the thing Astero had made. Was it even=
 edible?=20

"I asked Gwenda how to make it," he said, seeming quite proud of himself.=
=20

Gwenda was one of the bakers in the village, and she owned a pastry stall t=
hat sold delicious desserts. Rosella didn't know if she should blame this o=
n Gwenda's teaching skills or Astero's ability to bake. Probably the latter=
.=20

"It..." Rosella didn't know what to say. She looked up at him, and she didn=
't know what kind of face she was making, but Astero's smile slowly cracked=
.=20

Rosella quickly smiled and said, "It looks delicious!" and ate it all in on=
e bite.=20

She did her best not to gag.=20

"Really?" His eyes sparkled with delight. "I stayed up all night trying to =
make it."=20

Her heart ached, and she convinced herself it was the best food she had eve=
r had. "I loved it."=20

"I made more if you're still hungry!"=20

Rosella's stomach lurched at the thought of eating more, but she thought of=
 Astero in the kitchen all night baking whatever this was just for her. Ast=
ero, someone who likely never had to cook for himself, did this for her.=20

So she said she was hungry, and she ate three more until Rosella's stomach =
was on the brink of bringing it all back up.=20

For two hours, the pair walked along the road, and the entire journey, Rose=
lla barely noticed the pain in her feet, nor the sweat dripping down her fa=
ce. With nothing to do but converse on the road heading east, all Rosella w=
anted was to learn every little thing about Astero.=20

"Do you have siblings?" she had asked.=20

He shook his head. "Do you?"=20

"Two. An older brother and sister."=20

He looked surprised. "You do?"=20

"They're back home." Rosella pondered if she should tell him this, but perh=
aps it couldn't hurt. "I was actually banished from my home."=20

Strangely enough, Astero didn't look surprised. "I'm so sorry," he said, lo=
oking dejected.=20

She laughed, nudging his shoulder. "Always apologizing. Apologetic Astero."=
=20

Astero chuckled half heartedly. "That's me."=20

"They're twins," Rosella explained, wanting to talk about them, to feel clo=
ser to them somehow. "Five years older than me."=20

He smiled. "Us, too."=20

"Hmm?"=20

"You're five... years..." Astero seemed to have come to a realization and c=
losed his eyes, cringing. "Never mind."=20

"I'm five years older than you?" Rosella had no idea when they had talked a=
bout their ages. She could have sworn it never came up.=20

"What are their names?" he asked abruptly.=20

"Crisanto and Willow. Why are you changing the subject?"=20

"I know, you were talking about your siblings and I interrupted. I apologiz=
e." Astero bowed his head.=20

"That's not =E2=80=94 "=20

"Were you close with them?"=20

"I... yes, sort of." She decided to accept his desire to stay away from the=
 topic of their ages. "I was closer to my brother."=20

"Do you miss them?" he asked sadly.=20

"Of course." Rosella missed her family more than anything. She gazed up at =
the sky, wondering what they were doing at this moment. She imagined her fa=
ther had retired from clan leader duties, and perhaps Soro Crisanto had tak=
en over as leader. Anle Willow would be at his side, protecting him always,=
 hopefully when she returned from her travels around the sky. Anessia Aewin=
, Soro Crisanto's wife, would be there as well. Her mother and father would=
 be living in a cottage somewhere in the Ozario clan hillsides, surrounded =
by flowers.=20

The moment Rosella felt tears threatening to fall, she shook her head fierc=
ely and laughed. "Why are we talking about me? I was going to ask you quest=
ions."=20

"I want to know more about you," Astero replied easily, as if that didn't m=
ake her heart jump.=20

"But I'd like to know more about you too," she insisted. "Did your parents =
love flowers as well?"=20

"Hm? What makes you say that?"=20

"Your name," she pointed out. "All my siblings and I are named after flower=
s. My parents loved gardening."=20

Astero smiled, as if he were remembering something pleasant. "Yes, my mothe=
r loves flowers."=20

"Asters are beautiful," said Rosella, grinning. "Your mother has good taste=
."=20

He shook his head. "Roses are more beautiful," Astero insisted. "Especially=
 pink ones."=20

She rolled her eyes. "There you go flirting again."=20

"Can't I have an opinion?"=20

"You're cheeky."=20

Astero winked, and Rosella laughed, unable to remember a time when she had =
been so happy.=20

Until they reached a town to stop and rest, for two hours, the aster and th=
e rose stayed side by side, as if they were the only two flowers in the who=
le world.
