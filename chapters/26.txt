It has been just two weeks since Kona made her way to the ground, and in that time, she felt so much joy she didn't know what to do with herself. Perhaps this was the ground. Perhaps this was another part of the sky. Those thoughts did not bother Kona, for she enjoyed this place nonetheless. It began to feel like a fantasy, a dream she conjured up from the happier parts of her mind. She might have died the second she stepped on the ground, and this was the afterlife. Either way, she was certainly willing to stay. 

Kona stayed in the hospital, spending time with her new friends. Minnie was there for a broken leg. Damien was there for a spinal injury and was usually wheeled around by Lawrence, his younger brother, who was there for a broken cheekbone. And Kisani had some unknown illness that had been keeping her in the hospital for five years. 

She did not forget her original goal to find Astero Elessai. It had just taken a backseat to finding her footing on the ground. Surely Lady Willow would understand. Kona had spent her entire life fighting to survive, and for the first time, she found a place where she did not have to struggle. 

A few more days. She would give herself a few more days experiencing this bliss. 

Kona laid in the grass outside the hospital, gazing up at the land in the sky. Just above her, a war was about to start. Clans were against each other, preparing to kill one another for revenge. It was so much more peaceful here. 

A face appeared over Kona's. Kisani stood above her, displaying a wide smile that always took Kona's breath away. Even in the sky, Kona had never seen someone so beautiful, someone who radiated the warmth of the sun. 

"What are you doing?" she asked, moving to lay down beside her. 

Kisani was gentle but strong, and she was smarter than she let others believe. She took care of the others like an older sister, even though her physically weak body tired her out more than most people. In a way, Kona admired her. She was a different type of strong compared to Lady Willow. 

"Have you had lunch?" Kisani asked, her brown eyes turning amber in the sunlight.

"Not yet." 

"You should eat," scolded Kisani. "You're still healing, you know." 

"I will, I will." Despite the nagging, Kona couldn't help but smile. 

"Minnie's leaving today." Kisani gazed up at the land in the sky, a bittersweet expression on her face. "Damien and Lawrence are leaving in two weeks." 

"That's good, isn't it?" 

"It is." She sighed. "I'll just miss them." 

"They'll visit you," Kona assured. 

"I know." 

But she didn't look so sure. 

"They will," insisted Kona. 

"I just might be gone by the time they do." 

Kisani rarely voiced concern. She always had a smile on her face and never complained about her situation. Whenever the others asked her about it, she would tell them optimistically how treatment was going well. 

Kona didn't even comprehend that she could have been lying. 

"Did Celeste say anything?" Kona sat up so she could see Kisani better, and the other girl's gaze was empty, staring blankly up at Kona's home in the clouds. 

"She said I have two months, maybe less. Our village doesn't have the resources to cure me." 

"Then let's go somewhere that does have the resources." 

Kisani laughed, sounding uncharacteristically bitter. "Like where?" 

The Jourman clan was famous for its sciences and medicinal practices. Safiro Jourman was one of the best doctors in the sky, and his three children all grew up to become just like him. Their clan had produced cures for many illnesses, including the plague that nearly killed all of the north hundreds of years ago. If there was a place that had the ability to cure Kisani, it would be there. 

Besides, with her brown skin and thick dark hair, she already looked like a member of the Jourman clan. Kisani would blend in so easily. 

But revealing this to her, Kona would simultaneously be revealing she was from the sky. Her mission was obviously more important, and yet, wouldn't Kisani die without her help? 

"I..." Kona started. "There's - " 

"Hey!" Damien's voice came from the entrance to the hospital. "Minnie's leaving!"

Kisani sat up abruptly. She grabbed Kona's hand, and the two of them ran through the entrance, passing Damien and Lawrence, into the main room of the hospital. Minnie was there, grinning happily as she held the hands of two people, presumably her parents. 

The moment Minnie saw Kisani, her eyes turned watery, tears threatening to cascade down her cheeks. Kona learned that Minnie had been at the hospital for eight months, and Kisani had been there the entire time, caring for her. It didn't take long for Kona to see how close they were. 

Kisani let go of Kona's hand and bolted over to Minnie, bending down to embrace her small frame. Minnie's arms wrapped around Kisani's neck, and the two of them held on to each other for dear life, as if letting go meant letting go for good. 

"I'll visit you, I promise," Minnie sobbed. 

"You better." Kisani was also clearly crying, but she was likely holding in the tears to appear strong in front of Minnie. 

They let go of each other reluctantly, and Kona suddenly felt an ache in her chest. 

Lady Willow found her when she was ten years old. She was the person who saved her when Kona had nothing. To repay her, Kona stayed by Lady Willow's side, doing whatever she needed. For the past two weeks, when Kona was alone and afraid, it was her new friends, especially Kisani, who gave her joy. Kona had a duty to repay them, and if that meant revealing that she was from the sky, so be it. If it meant saving Kisani's life, it would be worth it. 

When Minnie left, Kona and Kisani sat in the dining hall with Damien and Lawrence, all eating together quietly. Damien, who usually radiated energy, seemed to have lost some of it. 

Kona wanted to say something, but she felt out of place. She had only known Minnie for two weeks, and out of everyone, Kona talked to her the least. They were both introverted and relied on the others for conversation. Kona spent most of her time with Kisani, and she only saw Minnie once in a while. 

However, she could clearly see how much the others cared for her, especially Kisani. And the thought that Kisani wouldn't be able to see Minnie again broke her heart. 

After lunch, Kisani had her usual checkup with Celeste. During this time, Kona usually went around the village and asked others if they knew someone named Astero Elessai.

This place was called Ludha, and it was the closest village by the northern staircase. Astero Elessai should have come across this place when he descended, so it was strange that no one seemed to have heard the name. Perhaps he had an alias, which, if he did, Kona would be immensely surprised, for she did not peg the Elessai heir to be rather intelligent. 

Apparently, strange people came and went from Ludha all the time. It was so close to the stairway that anyone from the sky would end up here. However, Kona was too cautious to ask about that. 

When she came back to the hospital, Kisani was usually in her room, waiting for her. Today, when Kona opened the doors, she was gone. 

"She's outside," said Celeste from behind her, passing by. Judging from her darkened expression, Kona knew this could be nothing good. 

She ran out the main entrance and went around back, where the garden was. On this summer day, the sky was gray and filled with clouds. 

Kisani sat on a bench surrounded by dead trees. The sounds of her sobs chilled Kona to the bone. She wanted to do something, but comforting someone was not her specialty. 

At that moment, Kisani looked up, her face red and tear-stained and hopeless. 

"Kona?" she called. 

Kona walked over slowly. "What happened?" 

"It's one month now." Kisani gave a harsh laugh. "A month." 

Kona didn't know what to say. 

"Do you know why my illness is incurable?" 

"Why?" 

"Apparently, it's an illness from the sky." 

Kona startled, stopping in her tracks just a few feet from Kisani. 

"I'm not from the sky," Kisanj said hurriedly, waving her hands almost frantically. "My father was, though. He was banished for trying to murder someone who was apparently like royalty." 

It was hard for Kona to process this. "That's... I don't believe it." 

"I know, it's hard to believe. He's dead now. Killed himself after trying to go back up. He tried using a little boy to get him up there, but the boy never came back, and my father lost all hope." 

"So your father had this illness?" 

She nodded. "My brother, too. It took him already." 

"Kisani, I can help you." 

Kisani looked up curiously. "What do you mean?" 

Kona looked around cautiously, her heart already pounding. She took a seat next to Kisani on the bench, clenching her fists together in an effort to keep from shaking. "I can get you to the sky," she whispered. "You can be treated there." 

Kisani's eyes widened. "Kona... what are you talking about?" 

Swallowing hard, despite the fear, Kona forced herself to get out the words. "I'm from the sky." 

Kisani just stared. 

"One of the clans up there specializes in medicine. They can cure almost any illness the sky has." Kona took Kisani's hands into her own. They were both deathly cold. "You need to come with me." 

"I... I don't understand." 

"We can sneak up the stairway. I have a way to do it."

Kona could not read the expression on Kisani's face. It was frozen, not revealing a hint of emotion. 

"Kisani?" 

She shook her head, her eyes staring at nothing. "I can't." 

"What?" 

"I can't.”

"Then you'll die!" 

Kisani's face hardened, and she stared daggers at Kona. "I'd rather die than turn to the sky for help." 

Kona flinched. 

Kisani stood up. Without saying a word, she stood up and walked away from Kona, presumably back to the hospital. 

She didn't even imagine Kisani would refuse her help. Kona's breaths came out harsh and quick, and she took out the knife she always kept in her shawl to calm herself down. Slicing a cut into her arm, Kona's breaths slowed. She sliced another, then another, watched the blood drip onto the ground. 

It would be okay. They could pretend this never happened.

<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">A face appeared over Kona's. Kisani stood above her, displaying a wide smile that always took Kona's breath away. Even in the sky, Kona had never seen someone so beautiful, someone who radiated the warmth of the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What are you doing?" she asked, moving to lay down beside her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani was gentle but strong, and she was smarter than she let others believe. She took care of the others like an older sister, even though her physically weak body tired her out more than most people. In a way, Kona admired her. She was a different type of strong compared to Lady Willow.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Have you had lunch?" Kisani asked, her brown eyes turning amber in the sunlight.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Not yet."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You should eat," scolded Kisani. "You're still healing, you know."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I will, I will." Despite the nagging, Kona couldn't help but smile.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Minnie's leaving today." Kisani gazed up at the land in the sky, a bittersweet expression on her face. "Damien and Lawrence are leaving in two weeks."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"That's good, isn't it?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"It is." She sighed. "I'll just miss them."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"They'll visit you," Kona assured.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I know."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">But she didn't look so sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"They will," insisted Kona.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I just might be gone by the time they do."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani rarely voiced concern. She always had a smile on her face and never complained about her situation. Whenever the others asked her about it, she would tell them optimistically how treatment was going well.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona didn't even comprehend that she could have been lying.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Did Celeste say anything?" Kona sat up so she could see Kisani better, and the other girl's gaze was empty, staring blankly up at Kona's home in the clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"She said I have two months, maybe less. Our village doesn't have the resources to cure me."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Then let's go somewhere that does have the resources."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani laughed, sounding uncharacteristically bitter. "Like where?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The Jourman clan was famous for its sciences and medicinal practices. Safiro Jourman was one of the best doctors in the sky, and his three children all grew up to become just like him. Their clan had produced cures for many illnesses, including the plague that nearly killed all of the north hundreds of years ago. If there was a place that had the ability to cure Kisani, it would be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Besides, with her brown skin and thick dark hair, she already looked like a member of the Jourman clan. Kisani would blend in so easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">But revealing this to her, Kona would simultaneously be revealing she was from the sky. Her mission was obviously more important, and yet, wouldn't Kisani die without her help?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I..." Kona started. "There's - "&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Hey!" Damien's voice came from the entrance to the hospital. "Minnie's leaving!"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani sat up abruptly. She grabbed Kona's hand, and the two of them ran through the entrance, passing Damien and Lawrence, into the main room of the hospital. Minnie was there, grinning happily as she held the hands of two people, presumably her parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The moment Minnie saw Kisani, her eyes turned watery, tears threatening to cascade down her cheeks. Kona learned that Minnie had been at the hospital for eight months, and Kisani had been there the entire time, caring for her. It didn't take long for Kona to see how close they were.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani let go of Kona's hand and bolted over to Minnie, bending down to embrace her small frame. Minnie's arms wrapped around Kisani's neck, and the two of them held on to each other for dear life, as if letting go meant letting go for good.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'll visit you, I promise," Minnie sobbed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You better." Kisani was also clearly crying, but she was likely holding in the tears to appear strong in front of Minnie.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">They let go of each other reluctantly, and Kona suddenly felt an ache in her chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Lady Willow found her when she was ten years old. She was the person who saved her when Kona had nothing. To repay her, Kona stayed by Lady Willow's side, doing whatever she needed. For the past two weeks, when Kona was alone and afraid, it was her new friends, especially Kisani, who gave her joy. Kona had a duty to repay them, and if that meant revealing that she was from the sky, so be it. If it meant saving Kisani's life, it would be worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">When Minnie left, Kona and Kisani sat in the dining hall with Damien and Lawrence, all eating together quietly. Damien, who usually radiated energy, seemed to have lost some of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona wanted to say something, but she felt out of place. She had only known Minnie for two weeks, and out of everyone, Kona talked to her the least. They were both introverted and relied on the others for conversation. Kona spent most of her time with Kisani, and she only saw Minnie once in a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">However, she could clearly see how much the others cared for her, especially Kisani. And the thought that Kisani wouldn't be able to see Minnie again broke her heart.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">After lunch, Kisani had her usual checkup with Celeste. During this time, Kona usually went around the village and asked others if they knew someone named Astero Elessai.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">This place was called Ludha, and it was the closest village by the northern staircase. Astero Elessai should have come across this place when he descended, so it was strange that no one seemed to have heard the name. Perhaps he had an alias, which, if he did, Kona would be immensely surprised, for she did not peg the Elessai heir to be rather intelligent.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Apparently, strange people came and went from Ludha all the time. It was so close to the stairway that anyone from the sky would end up here. However, Kona was too cautious to ask about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">When she came back to the hospital, Kisani was usually in her room, waiting for her. Today, when Kona opened the doors, she was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"She's outside," said Celeste from behind her, passing by. Judging from her darkened expression, Kona knew this could be nothing good.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She ran out the main entrance and went around back, where the garden was. On this summer day, the sky was gray and filled with clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani sat on a bench surrounded by dead trees. The sounds of her sobs chilled Kona to the bone. She wanted to do something, but comforting someone was not her specialty.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">At that moment, Kisani looked up, her face red and tear-stained and hopeless.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Kona?" she called.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona walked over slowly. "What happened?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"It's one month now." Kisani gave a harsh laugh. "A month."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona didn't know what to say.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Do you know why my illness is incurable?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Why?"&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Apparently, it's an illness from the sky."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona startled, stopping in her tracks just a few feet from Kisani.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm not from the sky," Kisanj said hurriedly, waving her hands almost frantically. "My father was, though. He was banished for trying to murder someone who was apparently like royalty."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">It was hard for Kona to process this. "That's... I don't believe it."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I know, it's hard to believe. He's dead now. Killed himself after trying to go back up. He tried using a little boy to get him up there, but the boy never came back, and my father lost all hope."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"So your father had this illness?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She nodded. "My brother, too. It took him already."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Kisani, I can help you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani looked up curiously. "What do you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona looked around cautiously, her heart already pounding. She took a seat next to Kisani on the bench, clenching her fists together in an effort to keep from shaking. "I can get you to the sky," she whispered. "You can be treated there."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani's eyes widened. "Kona... what are you talking about?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Swallowing hard, despite the fear, Kona forced herself to get out the words. "I'm from the sky."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani just stared.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"One of the clans up there specializes in medicine. They can cure almost any illness the sky has." Kona took Kisani's hands into her own. They were both deathly cold. "You need to come with me."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I... I don't understand."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"We can sneak up the stairway. I have a way to do it."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona could not read the expression on Kisani's face. It was frozen, not revealing a hint of emotion.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Kisani?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She shook her head, her eyes staring at nothing. "I can't."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I <i>can't.”</i></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Then you'll die!"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani's face hardened, and she stared daggers at Kona. "I'd rather die than turn to the <span style="font-style: italic;">sky</span> for help."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona flinched.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kisani stood up. Without saying a word, she stood up and walked away from Kona, presumably back to the hospital.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She didn't even imagine Kisani would refuse her help. Kona's breaths came out harsh and quick, and she took out the knife she always kept in her shawl to calm herself down. Slicing a cut into her arm, Kona's breaths slowed. She sliced another, then another, watched the blood drip onto the ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">It would be okay. They could pretend this never happened.</p><br><div dir="ltr">Sent from my iPhone</div></body></html>
