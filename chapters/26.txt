It has been just two weeks since Kona made her way to the ground, and in th=
at time, she felt so much joy she didn't know what to do with herself. Perh=
aps this was the ground. Perhaps this was another part of the sky. Those th=
oughts did not bother Kona, for she enjoyed this place nonetheless. It bega=
n to feel like a fantasy, a dream she conjured up from the happier parts of=
 her mind. She might have died the second she stepped on the ground, and th=
is was the afterlife. Either way, she was certainly willing to stay.=20

Kona stayed in the hospital, spending time with her new friends. Minnie was=
 there for a broken leg. Damien was there for a spinal injury and was usual=
ly wheeled around by Lawrence, his younger brother, who was there for a bro=
ken cheekbone. And Kisani had some unknown illness that had been keeping he=
r in the hospital for five years.=20

She did not forget her original goal to find Astero Elessai. It had just ta=
ken a backseat to finding her footing on the ground. Surely Lady Willow wou=
ld understand. Kona had spent her entire life fighting to survive, and for =
the first time, she found a place where she did not have to struggle.=20

A few more days. She would give herself a few more days experiencing this b=
liss.=20

Kona laid in the grass outside the hospital, gazing up at the land in the s=
ky. Just above her, a war was about to start. Clans were against each other=
, preparing to kill one another for revenge. It was so much more peaceful h=
ere.=20

A face appeared over Kona's. Kisani stood above her, displaying a wide smil=
e that always took Kona's breath away. Even in the sky, Kona had never seen=
 someone so beautiful, someone who radiated the warmth of the sun.=20

"What are you doing?" she asked, moving to lay down beside her.=20

Kisani was gentle but strong, and she was smarter than she let others belie=
ve. She took care of the others like an older sister, even though her physi=
cally weak body tired her out more than most people. In a way, Kona admired=
 her. She was a different type of strong compared to Lady Willow.=20

"Have you had lunch?" Kisani asked, her brown eyes turning amber in the sun=
light.

"Not yet."=20

"You should eat," scolded Kisani. "You're still healing, you know."=20

"I will, I will." Despite the nagging, Kona couldn't help but smile.=20

"Minnie's leaving today." Kisani gazed up at the land in the sky, a bitters=
weet expression on her face. "Damien and Lawrence are leaving in two weeks.=
"=20

"That's good, isn't it?"=20

"It is." She sighed. "I'll just miss them."=20

"They'll visit you," Kona assured.=20

"I know."=20

But she didn't look so sure.=20

"They will," insisted Kona.=20

"I just might be gone by the time they do."=20

Kisani rarely voiced concern. She always had a smile on her face and never =
complained about her situation. Whenever the others asked her about it, she=
 would tell them optimistically how treatment was going well.=20

Kona didn't even comprehend that she could have been lying.=20

"Did Celeste say anything?" Kona sat up so she could see Kisani better, and=
 the other girl's gaze was empty, staring blankly up at Kona's home in the =
clouds.=20

"She said I have two months, maybe less. Our village doesn't have the resou=
rces to cure me."=20

"Then let's go somewhere that does have the resources."=20

Kisani laughed, sounding uncharacteristically bitter. "Like where?"=20

The Jourman clan was famous for its sciences and medicinal practices. Safir=
o Jourman was one of the best doctors in the sky, and his three children al=
l grew up to become just like him. Their clan had produced cures for many i=
llnesses, including the plague that nearly killed all of the north hundreds=
 of years ago. If there was a place that had the ability to cure Kisani, it=
 would be there.=20

Besides, with her brown skin and thick dark hair, she already looked like a=
 member of the Jourman clan. Kisani would blend in so easily.=20

But revealing this to her, Kona would simultaneously be revealing she was f=
rom the sky. Her mission was obviously more important, and yet, wouldn't Ki=
sani die without her help?=20

"I..." Kona started. "There's - "=20

"Hey!" Damien's voice came from the entrance to the hospital. "Minnie's lea=
ving!"

Kisani sat up abruptly. She grabbed Kona's hand, and the two of them ran th=
rough the entrance, passing Damien and Lawrence, into the main room of the =
hospital. Minnie was there, grinning happily as she held the hands of two p=
eople, presumably her parents.=20

The moment Minnie saw Kisani, her eyes turned watery, tears threatening to =
cascade down her cheeks. Kona learned that Minnie had been at the hospital =
for eight months, and Kisani had been there the entire time, caring for her=
. It didn't take long for Kona to see how close they were.=20

Kisani let go of Kona's hand and bolted over to Minnie, bending down to emb=
race her small frame. Minnie's arms wrapped around Kisani's neck, and the t=
wo of them held on to each other for dear life, as if letting go meant lett=
ing go for good.=20

"I'll visit you, I promise," Minnie sobbed.=20

"You better." Kisani was also clearly crying, but she was likely holding in=
 the tears to appear strong in front of Minnie.=20

They let go of each other reluctantly, and Kona suddenly felt an ache in he=
r chest.=20

Lady Willow found her when she was ten years old. She was the person who sa=
ved her when Kona had nothing. To repay her, Kona stayed by Lady Willow's s=
ide, doing whatever she needed. For the past two weeks, when Kona was alone=
 and afraid, it was her new friends, especially Kisani, who gave her joy. K=
ona had a duty to repay them, and if that meant revealing that she was from=
 the sky, so be it. If it meant saving Kisani's life, it would be worth it.=
=20

When Minnie left, Kona and Kisani sat in the dining hall with Damien and La=
wrence, all eating together quietly. Damien, who usually radiated energy, s=
eemed to have lost some of it.=20

Kona wanted to say something, but she felt out of place. She had only known=
 Minnie for two weeks, and out of everyone, Kona talked to her the least. T=
hey were both introverted and relied on the others for conversation. Kona s=
pent most of her time with Kisani, and she only saw Minnie once in a while.=
=20

However, she could clearly see how much the others cared for her, especiall=
y Kisani. And the thought that Kisani wouldn't be able to see Minnie again =
broke her heart.=20

After lunch, Kisani had her usual checkup with Celeste. During this time, K=
ona usually went around the village and asked others if they knew someone n=
amed Astero Elessai.

This place was called Ludha, and it was the closest village by the northern=
 staircase. Astero Elessai should have come across this place when he desce=
nded, so it was strange that no one seemed to have heard the name. Perhaps =
he had an alias, which, if he did, Kona would be immensely surprised, for s=
he did not peg the Elessai heir to be rather intelligent.=20

Apparently, strange people came and went from Ludha all the time. It was so=
 close to the stairway that anyone from the sky would end up here. However,=
 Kona was too cautious to ask about that.=20

When she came back to the hospital, Kisani was usually in her room, waiting=
 for her. Today, when Kona opened the doors, she was gone.=20

"She's outside," said Celeste from behind her, passing by. Judging from her=
 darkened expression, Kona knew this could be nothing good.=20

She ran out the main entrance and went around back, where the garden was. O=
n this summer day, the sky was gray and filled with clouds.=20

Kisani sat on a bench surrounded by dead trees. The sounds of her sobs chil=
led Kona to the bone. She wanted to do something, but comforting someone wa=
s not her specialty.=20

At that moment, Kisani looked up, her face red and tear-stained and hopeles=
s.=20

"Kona?" she called.=20

Kona walked over slowly. "What happened?"=20

"It's one month now." Kisani gave a harsh laugh. "A month."=20

Kona didn't know what to say.=20

"Do you know why my illness is incurable?"=20

"Why?"=20

"Apparently, it's an illness from the sky."=20

Kona startled, stopping in her tracks just a few feet from Kisani.=20

"I'm not from the sky," Kisanj said hurriedly, waving her hands almost fran=
tically. "My father was, though. He was banished for trying to murder someo=
ne who was apparently like royalty."=20

It was hard for Kona to process this. "That's... I don't believe it."=20

"I know, it's hard to believe. He's dead now. Killed himself after trying t=
o go back up. He tried using a little boy to get him up there, but the boy =
never came back, and my father lost all hope."=20

"So your father had this illness?"=20

She nodded. "My brother, too. It took him already."=20

"Kisani, I can help you."=20

Kisani looked up curiously. "What do you mean?"=20

Kona looked around cautiously, her heart already pounding. She took a seat =
next to Kisani on the bench, clenching her fists together in an effort to k=
eep from shaking. "I can get you to the sky," she whispered. "You can be tr=
eated there."=20

Kisani's eyes widened. "Kona... what are you talking about?"=20

Swallowing hard, despite the fear, Kona forced herself to get out the words=
. "I'm from the sky."=20

Kisani just stared.=20

"One of the clans up there specializes in medicine. They can cure almost an=
y illness the sky has." Kona took Kisani's hands into her own. They were bo=
th deathly cold. "You need to come with me."=20

"I... I don't understand."=20

"We can sneak up the stairway. I have a way to do it."

Kona could not read the expression on Kisani's face. It was frozen, not rev=
ealing a hint of emotion.=20

"Kisani?"=20

She shook her head, her eyes staring at nothing. "I can't."=20

"What?"=20

"I can't.=E2=80=9D

"Then you'll die!"=20

Kisani's face hardened, and she stared daggers at Kona. "I'd rather die tha=
n turn to the sky for help."=20

Kona flinched.=20

Kisani stood up. Without saying a word, she stood up and walked away from K=
ona, presumably back to the hospital.=20

She didn't even imagine Kisani would refuse her help. Kona's breaths came o=
ut harsh and quick, and she took out the knife she always kept in her shawl=
 to calm herself down. Slicing a cut into her arm, Kona's breaths slowed. S=
he sliced another, then another, watched the blood drip onto the ground.=20

It would be okay. They could pretend this never happened.
