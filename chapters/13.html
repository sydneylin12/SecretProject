		"Astero, are you awake?" Rosella called from outside his door. It was past sunrise, and Jayda had already eaten
		breakfast and left for work. Astero still had not left his room.



		Rosella tried knocking. "Astero?"



		There was still no reply. She began to grow concerned. Perhaps he had starved to death after only eating
		blackberry pie yesterday. Panic began to set in her mind, and Rosella made up her mind to quietly turn the knob
		and open the door.



		He lay there on the floor, arms and legs sprawled out in all directions. The mats and blankets had been for
		Rosella when she would have to sleep outside or on people's floors, so they weren't suited for Astero's tall
		frame. He must have had a hard time sleeping last night which would explain him sleeping in this morning.



		She wanted to let him sleep, but she needed to leave soon, and Rosella did not want him to awaken to an empty
		house.



		"Astero," she said, a bit louder than a whisper.



		He did not even stir.



		Rosella sighed, walking over to his sleeping form. She crouched down and lightly pushed his shoulder. "Astero,
		wake up."



		He groaned, but his eyes remained shut.



		"Breakfast is ready," Rosella told him.



		Astero shook his head, rolling onto his side. "I'll eat in my room today."



		Rosella laughed quietly. "You have to come downstairs, I can't bring it all up here."



		"Then have another servant do it."



		Rosella was taken aback, suddenly feeling a crushing sense of disappointment in her heart. "I didn't think you
		would treat me like a servant, too."



		Astero's eyes snapped open, and he sat up quickly. He looked around the room, as if he had forgotten where he
		was. Then, he glanced at Rosella, shock written all over his face. "I'm sorry, I... I thought I was at home."



		She didn't know what to say, not when he was looking at her so earnestly.



		"I'm sorry," he said again, swallowing hard. "You didn't need to make me breakfast."



		Rosella smiled. "It sounds like you're used to people making you breakfast."



		He opened his mouth as if he was going to speak, but then he closed it again.



		"I know you didn't want to be forced into marriage, but you must've had quite a luxurious home life."



		Astero looked away but said nothing, confirming Rosella's intuitions.



		"Why would you give that up?"



		He stared off into the distance, his eyes clear and determined. "There was something more important."



		For the first time, Rosella noticed his features. He was paler than her but still lightly tanned, his skin
		smooth and flawless. There was a small mole just below his left eye, right on his cheekbone. His black hair was
		a tousled mess at the moment, but he still looked incredibly handsome. The poise he carried from just sitting up
		in bed... it was quite obvious he came from a wealthy family.



		When Rosella was back home in the sky, money was never an issue. The Ozario clan was actually the least wealthy
		of the five clans in the north, but they were still very well off. However, when she came to the ground, Rosella
		had to learn that money was probably the most valuable thing in the world. She would certainly give up a loving
		marriage for money.



		What could possibly be more important?



		Suddenly, a grumbling sound came from Astero's stomach, and he smiled sheepishly. "Ah, ignore that."



		Rosella laughed, standing up and brushing off her dress. "Come on, breakfast is ready."



		"Next time, I'll help you," said Astero, his voice leaving no room for argument. "Just wake me up."



		"Can you even cook?"



		He hesitated, then shook his head in defeat.



		She smiled and reached down, grabbing his arm to help him stand up. "Just eat my food then."



		"I can buy you food," Astero suggested, rising to his feet. Standing this close to him, Rosella realized he was
		much taller than she was. Her head barely reached his chin.



		Rosella looked up at him, only to realize he was staring down at her, his sweet, innocent eyes so familiar.



		"Are you sure we haven't met before?" she asked, gazing curiously at him.



		For a moment, she could have sworn she saw panic in his eyes. But then, Astero just looked away and cleared his
		throat. "I don't think we have," he said, his voice rough.



		Rosella continued to stare at him, racking deep into her mind for where she could have seen him before.



		Astero looked back at her, noticing her predicament, and he gave her a cheeky grin. "I'm sure I would have
		remembered meeting you."



		She rolled her eyes and turned around, heading for the door. "Stop flirting and come eat."



		"I'll be right down!" he called after her as Rosella left the room and shut the door.



		Rosella had to admit to herself that she had grown quite fond of him. Last night, as they ate together in his
		room, it was the most she had laughed in a long time. Astero was sweet, awkward, and seemed very child-like with
		how curious he was about anything and everything. He said his family loved art and poetry, and while he wasn't
		as good at creating stories, he loved reading them. He was an only child who was spoiled by his parents, but he
		mentioned he and his father had been estranged lately due to his forced engagement. Rosella had asked if he
		planned to return home, and Astero had said that he truly did not know. He said that sometimes, he felt like a
		stranger in his own household. While Astero had never left home before, Rosella was always forced to leave her
		home. She couldn't help but be envious.



		Astero came downstairs after a few minutes, all dressed and looking as prim and proper as he did yesterday. He
		smiled as he saw her, and Rosella's heart warmed instantly. Yesterday at the marketplace, he had been so nervous
		that Rosella worried she was making him uncomfortable. Fortunately, he seemed more at ease.



		"Jayda only ate a bit and left for work, so the rest is for you," Rosella explained, giving him a plate and
		utensils.



		"What about you?" he asked, sitting down.



		"I ate earlier. I just wanted to wake you up to let you know I'm leaving."



		His eyes widened, and Astero stood up abruptly. "Leaving?"



		"For work," she clarified, stuffing her bag with the cleaning supplies she'd need for the day's job. "I'll be
		back before dinner."



		"I'll come with you."



		"You haven't even eaten yet."



		He glanced at the table, then back at her. "Just... wait for me then."



		"Why do you want to come?"



		"I want to help you."



		"Astero, I really can't afford to split the pay for this job," Rosella said, feeling sorry. But she desperately
		needed the money.



		He tilted his head, as if confused. "You can have all the money. I just want to help."



		Rosella sighed. She reached up and placed both hands on his shoulders, then pushed him down so he was seated in
		the chair. "Just eat. I'll be back soon."



		"You don't have to go," he said, eyes pleading. "I can give you money."



		"I can't take your money."



		"How much do you need?"



		"Astero, money is important," Rosella scolded. "You're lucky to have a lot of it, so use it for yourself."



		"Why can't I use it for you?"



		"Why would you even want to?" she asked, growing concerned for him. Was he so deeply infatuated with her? Or did
		he just have enough money to throw around?



		"Because you deserve it." Astero's voice was soft and gentle, like a warm wind blowing.



		Rosella didn't know what to say. She hadn't done anything to deserve his money, but Astero was so insistent on
		helping her. He bought her food and clothes, and now he was offering her money. She couldn't see how this
		benefitted him in any way.



		She deserved it? What had she done for him to deserve it?



		"Or you can sell the necklace!" Astero suggested enthusiastically. "It's worth at least sixty coins."



		Rosella's eyes nearly bulged out of her head. "Sixty coins?" she whispered in disbelief.



		He nodded assuredly. "It won't be any less than that, I promise."



		It was tempting. However, Rosella shook her head. "I cannot give away a gift."



		"But I gave it to you to do as you wish."



		"I cannot," she said with a tone of finality. "You gave it to me and I will keep it."



		"But you haven't worn it," he said, disappointment seeping into his voice. "Nor the dress."



		She wanted to. Desperately. To wear the pink colors of the Ozario clan again... that was something she thought
		she would never be able to do. Astero had given her that opportunity, and she was eternally grateful just to
		have those things in her possession. For the first time in a long time, she finally felt like Young Lady Ozario,
		as she was once called. But she needed to earn it first, and to do that, she needed to pay him back.



		"I will," she promised, patting his hand for reassurance. "I'm just not used to wearing such nice things. But I
		will."



		His face suddenly turned very solemn, as if he were remembering a very painful memory. "I'm sorry."



		"You always say that," Rosella joked, trying to keep her voice lighthearted. "What are you always sorry for,
		hm?"



		He looked as if he wanted to tell her something, then thought better of it and said nothing. "Can I go with
		you?" Astero said instead. "I just want something to do. I really don't need any money."



		Rosella hesitated, but she figured it was no use hiding how pitiful she was from him any longer. "Fine. But eat
		first."



		Astero smiled and happily ate the breakfast prepared for him.



		She didn't know why he cared so much, or what he was trying to do. But she knew that her heart had opened up a
		place for him. It hadn't done that for anybody in a long time.
