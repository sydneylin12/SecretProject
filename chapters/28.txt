The small town Rosella and Astero stopped at seemed even smaller than the o=
ne close to Onen, and Rosella desperately hoped word hadn't spread here abo=
ut her nearly killing a town leader. If anyone knew about her here, it woul=
d be inevitable coming into contact with them.=20

"Would this place even have horses?" Astero asked, scanning his surrounding=
s, seeming strangely fascinated.

"It should," Rosella replied, looking around the weary town. "We can ask ar=
ound for a stable master =E2=80=94 "

Before she should continue, beside her, Astero suddenly gasped. He started =
running in the direction of a vendor that seemed to be selling flowers.=20

Or, no. It appeared that they were selling flower crowns. The people walkin=
g away from the stall wore different styles of it. Some had large wreaths w=
ith a variety of colors. Others were more plain, with just a simple band an=
d a few flowers spread out. Still, it didn't look any less beautiful.=20

Rosella didn't want to just leave him to go find a stable master on her own=
, so she decided to wait. And when he returned, he held out a thin crown wi=
th pink snapdragons and small white baby's breath. The Ozario clan grew all=
 sorts of flowers in their massive garden, and Rosella could recognize them=
 instantly. Many flowers from the ground were the same as those in the sky.

"And what is that for?" Rosella asked, smiling.=20

"I thought I'd replace the hat you lost," Astero said with a grin.=20

"That is unlikely to shield me from the sun." Despite her words, Rosella st=
epped closer, bowing her head slightly.=20

He placed it atop her head gently, as if she were a queen being crowned. Ro=
sella hadn't felt like a person of much importance for a long, long time, a=
nd all of a sudden, here appeared someone who treated her as if she were ro=
yalty.=20

"You look radiant, my lady," Astero declared, giving her a bow as if he wer=
e a valet.=20

A giggle burst from her lips. "You're ridiculous."=20

Astero stood up from his bow. He looked at her, and his expression morphed =
into something akin to fondness, as if he were thinking of a memory dear to=
 his heart.=20

Rosella didn't know what else to do but smile. "Thank you, Astero."=20

He shook his head and turned away, as if the sight of her now burned his vi=
sion. "You don't ever have to thank me."=20

She did not know why his demeanor suddenly darkened. The first thought that=
 came to her mind was that perhaps she reminded him of someone, such as the=
 fianc=C3=A9e he left behind. Then, Rosella remembered he hated that fianc=
=C3=A9e. This led her to think she might have reminded him of his actual tr=
ue love, which he never said he had, but Rosella thought it was a possibili=
ty, and he might have been feeling guilty for staying with Rosella instead.

Maybe she was overthinking this.=20

Rosella strolled up to him and hooked her arm through his. "You've done so =
much for me, why wouldn't I thank you?"=20

He glanced at her, surprised. "I didn't do that much."=20

She rolled her eyes. "Whatever you say."=20

Astero said nothing for a moment. He simply scanned their surroundings, obs=
erving the people milling about. There was so much laughter and movement in=
 this place, Rosella couldn't help but admire it as well. It was still a no=
rthern town, but the atmosphere seemed different than the one close to Onen=
.=20

"Shall we find an inn and have lunch?" Astero proposed suddenly.=20

Rosella looked at him, confused. "We're only here to buy the horses."=20

"Or, we can stay here for a bit longer," Astero suggested, grinning. "Say, =
a week?"=20

"And do what?"=20

"Nothing."=20

"Nothing?"=20

"You don't always need to be doing something. You can relax, you know."=20

Doing nothing was a treasure only those with money could afford. Up in the =
sky, there were many days Rosella spent doing nothing, walking leisurely th=
rough the Ozario clan garden, strolling through the towns, playing in the m=
anor hallways without a care in the world. Those days were long gone, and e=
ver since coming to the ground, all Rosella had done was work.=20

"What do you mean, relax?" she asked curiously.=20

He shrugged. "Explore the town. Buy things. Sightsee."=20

"The town isn't that big," Rosella pointed out.=20

"Then we can visit other ones. See the villages. And we can come back here =
by the day's end."=20

"But that =E2=80=94 " Seems like a waste of time.=20

Then again, what was she using her time for? Was she saving it up for somet=
hing important? No amount of work would buy her way back to the sky. That l=
ife was long gone, and Rosella needed to accept that she'd never see her fa=
mily again.

All she could do was enjoy her time down here, with someone she did have. W=
ith Astero.=20

"But whatever you want to do, I am okay with." Astero smiled, and it seemed=
 he genuinely did not care what they did, as long as they were together.=20

And that made Rosella's heart burst with joy.=20

So she nodded, feeling more determined than ever. "All right. We can stay f=
or a week."=20

His smile widened, and she couldn't help but do the same.=20

"Let's look for an inn," he said, holding out his hand palm-up amidst their=
 hooked arms.=20

Rosella took it, and together they walked along the stone paths through the=
 town, as if they were simply lovers on a stroll.=20

Content. That was how Rosella felt being with Astero. And she felt as if sh=
e could travel the world with him for the rest of her life. She couldn't he=
lp feeling more and more attached. The swish of her dress against her ankle=
s, the cool touch of the necklace against her chest, his warm hand envelopi=
ng hers. Not to mention the crown on her head, as well as the purple flower=
s on the road. He was everywhere, surrounding her every being.=20

Maybe this is what love feels like.

Rosella had been with her fair share of men over the years. But to say she =
had experienced something like love with any of them would be a lie. She ne=
eded a place to stay, or she needed money, or even something as straightfor=
ward as companionship.=20

Astero gave her money. He gave her companionship and help when she needed i=
t. And yet, she felt differently about him.=20

As they walked, Astero chattered excitedly about spots in the town they cou=
ld go or things he wanted to buy. Rosella looked up at him, at his sparklin=
g eyes, listening to his voice that could have droned on for hours, and she=
 would have captured every word.=20

At last, they came across an inn that looked as if it were falling apart. T=
he cost had been ten coins per night, and Rosella thought they might have b=
een tricked, for the place did not look to be worth ten coins. However, Ast=
ero was more than willing to pay.=20

"I have enough," he assured when she brought it up. "Don't worry about the =
money."=20

Money was all Rosella ever worried about.=20

The innkeeper gave them a set of keys and led them to their room which cons=
isted of two wooden cots so small that Astero's legs were likely to dangle =
off the edge, a wooden nightstand with a candelabra in between them, and a =
dresser that appeared much too dusty. Another wooden door stood in the corn=
er of the room, and Rosella hoped it led to a washroom, although she would =
completely understand if it led to nothing. The room was dark and musty, th=
e only light coming from a tiny window covered by grimy curtains.=20

"This is certainly not worth ten coins," Rosella muttered, swiping dust off=
 the wall.

Astero coughed, swiping at the dust-filled air in front of him. "Well, let'=
s just stay here to sleep. During the day, we can be out and about."=20

"That sounds good to me," agreed Rosella, dropping off her bags in the room=
. Astero followed her lead, and then the two stepped out of the room, shutt=
ing the door and locking it.=20

"Where should we have lunch?" Astero asked as the two started down the hall=
way.=20

"I think we passed a place that sold southern food."

Astero looked thoughtful. "I've never had southern food."=20

Rosella shrugged. "Neither have I."=20

"Shall we explore the wonders of the world together then?" His voice was pl=
ayful, and Rosella couldn't help but laugh.=20

"We shall."=20

Together, they left the inn and found the eatery that served southern food.=
 Rosella thought the food was delicious, certainly better than northern cui=
sine. However, Astero insisted that eastern food would be much better, goin=
g on and on about foods he had eaten while visiting his mother's family.

"You'll love it," he promised. "Have you ever had plum fish?"=20

"I can't say I have," she replied, smiling at his excitement.

"And dragonfruit tarts! My mother loves those."=20

Talking to Astero like this, over food, in a new place, on a beautiful summ=
er day, was the most fun Rosella had experienced in years.

As for payment, Rosella insisted on at least splitting the pay, and she wou=
ld hear none of his protests.=20

"You have paid for everything," she pointed out, placing her coins down on =
the table. "What sort of person would I be if I did not do the same?"=20

If it were anyone else, Rosella would have allowed them to pay for everythi=
ng if they insisted. But with Astero, she wanted to care for him as much as=
 he did for her.=20

"Where to now?" Rosella asked as they left the eatery.=20

He shrugged. "The marketplace?"=20

She took his hand. "Let's go."=20

"Would you like a new dress?" he asked teasingly as the two walked.=20

Rosella rolled her eyes. "Why don't you get yourself some clothes?"=20

"I have all the clothes I need." Astero gestured to his tattered rags he bo=
ught in Onen.=20

"Why don't you add some color?" Rosella suggested.=20

"What would look good on me?" he asked.

"Hmm." She glanced him over. Truthfully, he would look good in anything. Ev=
en his plain shirt and trousers did not detract from his beautiful face. Ho=
wever, there was a color that would be perfect. "Purple."

He gave a surprised laugh. "Purple?"=20

"Asters are purple," she explained. "I think it would look nice!"=20

They had finally reached the marketplace, which was a long street full of v=
endors selling food, clothes, jewelry, and anything imaginable. It was crow=
ded, endless chatter filling the air.=20

"Perhaps I will find myself something purple then." Astero seemed excited n=
ow as he looked on at the bustling street, his expression full of fascinati=
on. He then turned to her, his eyes softening. "And whatever you would like=
, just let me know."=20

She nudged his shoulder playfully. "I do have my own money."=20

"So you should save it."=20

"Shouldn't I spend it here?"=20

"Why spend your money when you can just spend mine?"=20

Oh, how she would have taken that deal lightning fast had he been any other=
 man.=20

Rosella shook her head fiercely. "Why do you want to spend your money on me=
?" =20

He opened his mouth as if to say something, then paused. "I... well..."=20

Surely he could not get out of explaining himself now.=20

"...well?" Rosella encouraged eagerly, heart pounding.

"I just =E2=80=94 "

A hand was placed on Rosella's shoulder, catching her by surprise, and she =
flinched away into Astero, who held her steady.=20

"Come, come!" said the man who startled Rosella, gesturing towards his clot=
hing stall. "I have matching garments for couples. Normally five coins tota=
l, but I'll lower it just for you!"

"Ah, we're okay," replied Rosella, laughing nervously, either due to the fa=
ct that the man had called them a couple, or at the way Astero's arms were =
around her, as if it were instinct to protect her.=20

"Just take a look!" the man persisted, gesturing even more insistently to h=
is stall. Rosella did, and the clothes he sold were indeed beautiful. There=
 were matching colors and designs, one in particular catching her eye. All =
white, the dress for her being knee-length and sleeveless, with the matchin=
g white trousers and button-down tunic for Astero.=20

She glanced up and noticed him looking too.

"They're beautiful, aren't they?" pressed the seller. "I'm sure one is catc=
hing your eye."=20

"Which one do you like?" Astero asked quietly in her ear.=20

"The white one," she replied almost instantly. Then, she retracted. "You do=
n't have to get it, though."=20

"We'll buy the white one," Astero told the seller.=20

Rosella looked at him incredulously.=20

"Excellent choice!" exclaimed the man. He took it off the clothing rack and=
 handed it to Astero. "Four coins. Would you like me to put it in a cloth b=
ag?"=20

"Yes, please," said Astero, taking out the small pouch carrying his coins.=
=20

"That will be two additional coins, then."=20

Rosella choked, but Astero didn't seem to mind. He handed the man six coins=
 in exchange for the bag with the clothes.=20

"Have a wonderful day!" said the man, waving at them happily as they walked=
 away.=20

"Astero," Rosella hissed. "You =E2=80=94 "

"Let's wear these tomorrow!" proclaimed Astero, swinging the bag at his sid=
e.=20

She sighed.=20

"Rosella." Astero's voice had gone serious all of a sudden. "I have been en=
joying myself my whole life. Anything I wanted, I could get. I just... I ju=
st want you to enjoy yourself too."=20

Enjoying life. Another concept that was reserved for those with money. And =
yet, Astero's words struck a chord in her heart. She didn't know what to sa=
y, and not a word could escape her throat.=20

"Just for the week," he promised. "Then, you can focus on saving money, if =
you'd like."=20

His eyes seemed so determined, Rosella did not think she had a choice.=20

"All right," she conceded. "One week."=20

Astero smiled as if he had won something, and Rosella felt strangely giddy.=
 The thought of buying whatever she wanted was terrifying, yet intriguing.=
=20

For the rest of the day, Rosella and Astero remained in the market. Despite=
 her new determination to enjoy herself and buy whatever caught her eye, Ro=
sella only ended up purchasing two items. One being a bottle of liquid soap=
 with a lavender scent, the other being a wooden hair brush. Rosella still =
could not bring herself to buy anything but essentials, but perhaps she wou=
ld try again tomorrow.=20

"What are we doing tomorrow?" Rosella asked, the two finally leaving the ma=
rket and heading to their inn for dinner.=20

Astero's face lit up. "Whatever we want."=20

And for a week, that was exactly what the two did. They explored the town, =
walked through the marketplace, bought new clothes and ate new food, and th=
ey even explored the nearby villages.=20

In the evenings, they would go to their tiny room in the inn, sometimes goi=
ng to sleep, sometimes staying up late to talk.=20

"If you had all the money in the world, what would you do with it?" Astero =
had asked one night as they lay in their own beds, the candelabra between t=
hem aflame.=20

"I'd buy a large mansion," Rosella replied easily, staring at the ceiling, =
imagining what her dream home would look like. "It would have a beautiful f=
lower garden surrounding it, as big as the mansion itself." It suddenly occ=
urred to her that she was simply describing the Ozario clan manor.=20

"Would you have servants?" Astero inquired curiously.=20

"Of course!" she exclaimed. "People to clean the manor, people to tend to t=
he garden. I would never have to work again!" The thought made her sigh dre=
amily.=20

He laughed. "Would it just be you living there?"=20

"My family is welcome, of course. The servants would stay as well." She tur=
ned her head to look at him. "You too, if you'd like."=20

"I would be honored."=20

"And what if it were you who had all the money in the world?" Rosella asked=
.=20

"I would give it all to you so you can buy your mansion," he replied easily=
.=20

When he said things like that, how could she not feel as if she were fallin=
g?=20

However, if he knew who she really was, about her past and her banishment, =
would he still stay that?=20

Rosella hadn't gone this long without working in a long time, and there wer=
e moments she felt as if this were a waste of time. What if Astero decided =
to leave after convincing her to happily spend her coins on anything she de=
sired, leaving Rosella stranded without a single coin to her name? All of t=
his would have been for nothing.=20

And so, she made up her mind to tell him the truth.
