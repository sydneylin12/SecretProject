		Zhilin sat atop the dais, lounging in the chair that had once belonged to his father. He found is slightly
		uncomfortable, and even after months of sitting on it, he couldn't get used to it.



		He had always believed he wasn't suited for a leadership role. His older sister was supposed to have succeeded
		their father as the Fen clan leader, but she had been forced to marry a man who threatened their clan just for
		her hand in marriage.



		Despite Josemi Mie saying that she had forgiven Kairo Elessai since then, Zhilin did not, and neither did their
		siblings. It had been traumatizing seeing their older sister, normally strong and courageous, powerless in the
		face of the domineering Elessai clan. She was supposed to marry someone she loved, or at least, someone who
		would treat her with respect. Not someone like him, who stormed their clan and threatened their people with war.
		Josemi Mie had agreed to the marriage with determined eyes, willing to make this sacrifice for her people.
		However, when Zhilin went to visit her after she was finished getting ready, she looked as if she were trying to
		hold herself together, forcing herself to smile at her reflection in the glass. It made Zhilin sick.



		No matter how much time had passed, Zhilin had never forgiven Kairo Elessai for taking his sister away.



		When Willow Ozario arrived in their clan shortly after he took over as leader, he did not hesitate to agree to
		her and Crisanto Ozario's plan. He sent Xen Fen to assist them, as he was the best warrior in the entire clan.
		Luxian was busy preparing the army for their attack on the north, and Zhilin had sent letters to Meira and Anji
		who were living in their new respective clans, informing them of the process. They had enlisted the help of
		their husbands to assist in the battle.



		They would bring down Kairo Elessai. Then, they would bring their sister home.



		"Lord Fen." The attendant in front of Zhilin bowed. "Xen Fen has arrived."



		Zhilin nodded. "Bring him in."



		Xen walked into the room, his steps silent and stealthy. He wore robes that were mostly black, with black bands
		tied around his waist and arms, allowing for quick and easy movement. A straw hat sat atop his head, and the red
		ribbons tied to it flowed loosely along with his long black hair. His thin, up-turned eyes were as emotionless
		and intimidating as ever, but Zhilin had known Xen since he was a young boy. Xen appeared cold and menacing, but
		he was actually quite sweet, albeit a bit awkward.



		"Has the plan begun?" Zhilin asked as Xen bowed.



		"Yes, my lord," he replied. "But the news I bring may change things."



		"How so?"



		"I overheard Lord and Lady Ozario speaking to each other of the plan. Their intentions are more extreme than
		they initially told us."



		"What do you mean?"



		"They don't plan to kill the clan leaders. They plan to torture them by killing those closest to them."



		Zhilin didn't like where this was going.



		"That includes Astero Sa and Lady Elessai."



		Zhilin slammed his fist against the chair's arm rest, red filling his vision. "They wouldn't dare."



		"I'm afraid their hatred may be even greater than yours."



		"Summon Luxian," Zhilin commanded to the guards by his side. One of them hurriedly left to find him.



		"There's more," continued Xen.



		Zhilin was silent.



		"Sa has gone to the ground."



		It felt as if his heart had stopped beating.



		"No one knows why, but apparently he went there of his own free will."



		When his mother was still alive, she told Zhilin and his siblings horror stories of the ground. It was full of
		monsters disguised as humans, and whenever someone from the sky was sent down there, they would tear them to
		pieces, feasting on their flesh.



		The air suddenly felt much, much colder.



		"Does Josemi Mie know?" he asked quietly.



		Xen nodded. "Lady Ozario talked to her."



		"And what are they doing about it?"



		"They're using him against her. They sent someone down there to find him in exchange for her help."



		Zhilin gripped the arm rests of his chair, taking deep, calming breaths.



		Why could Astero have gone down there?



		"And once they find him," Zhilin said quietly, "they will kill him."



		"Which means we'll have to find him first!"



		Zhilin looked up to see Luxian strolling into the room, an easygoing smile on his face.



		It was easy to see that Luxian was Xen's role model. They both wore tighter robes, favored the color black, and
		left their long hair down. Luxian still wore red, but his outer robes were black and made of leather, like
		armor.



		He moved to stand beside Xen, looking up at Zhilin. "Xen can go to the ground," he suggested easily.



		Xen's eyes widened every so slightly, but it looked to be more out of surprise than fear.



		However, Xen was still young and believed nothing would frighten him. "Absolutely not," said Zhilin. "Why would
		you even suggest that?"



		Luxian took a step closer. His expression seemed more earnest now. "Sa, Xen is the best warrior in the clan,
		probably the best in the entire eastern sky. If Astero can survive down there, so can he."



		"How do we even know he's still alive?" Zhilin demanded.



		"He must have had something to do if he went there willingly. I can't imagine he'd just let himself die. And he
		wouldn't leave Miemie."



		"And how is Xen supposed to get down there?"



		Xen raised his hand.



		"...Yes, Xen?"



		"I may have given them some paralysis needles to use to descend."



		Zhilin and Luxian balked.



		Xen shrunk back. "I had to contribute something. They don't know how to recreate it anyway."



		"And you didn't think to run this by us first?" Luxian shouted, uncharacteristically mad.



		Immediately, Xen dropped to his knees and bowed so low his hat nearly fell off. "I humbly apologize and will
		accept any punishment you see fit, my lords."



		Zhilin groaned frustratedly. "Is that how Astero did it?"



		"I believe so," Xen replied.



		Zhilin stood up from his seat. "Very well. Your punishment will be to go to the ground and find my nephew before
		the Ozarios do. Do not return until you find him, understand?"



		Xen stood up and nodded determinedly. "Yes, Lord Fen."



		He didn't want to admit it, but Luxian was right. If Astero, who Zhilin remembered had no talent for martial
		arts, went to the ground and was most likely still alive, Xen could very well do the same. The Ozarios had sent
		someone down there as well. Did they have no fear? Would they truly do anything to punish the northern leaders?



		The only one Zhilin saw as an enemy was Kairo Elessai. He didn't know how all of them could have angered
		Crisanto and Willow Ozario so much.



		But he would not let them kill his sister and her son. Zhilin would use them to get rid of Kairo Elessai, and
		then, he would get rid of them if he had to.



		"What shall I do once I find him?" Xen asked.



		"Bring him here," replied Zhilin. "I'll send word to Mie."



		"Or I can go to the north and bring her here," suggested Luxian.



		Zhilin shook his head. "There has always been tension between us and the Elessai, but the others are cautious of
		us now as well. This always happens when someone new assumes leadership."



		"We can't leave her there," Luxian protested.



		"When the time comes, we'll protect her," assured Zhilin.



		Luxian nodded. "Understood." He turned to Xen. "And you."



		Xen tilted his head in confusion. "Me?"



		"You'll leave immediately."



		"Yes, Commander Fen."



		"And when you come back," said Luxian, stepping closer to Xen, the height difference almost comical, "we will
		discuss what you did."



		Xen looked down, his hat obscuring his face. "Yes, my lord."



		"That means, you will come back, understand?"



		"Yes, my lord."



		"You will come back in two weeks time, or I will go down there myself."



		Xen knelt to the ground on one knee. "I will not trouble you, my lord. I will bring him back here before two
		weeks time."



		"We know you will," interjected Zhilin. "Take the needles and whatever supplies you need. Luxian, accompany him
		to the stairway."



		The two of them bowed. "Yes, Lord Fen." Then they left immediately, leaving Zhilin alone with his guards in the
		main room. He sat back down in the chair and rested his head in his hand, closing his eyes exasperatedly.



		Was he doing the right thing, sending Xen to the ground, despite knowing how dangerous it was? Xen was only
		twenty-one and had his whole life ahead of him. If he died down there, Zhilin would never forgive himself.



		He had to be careful of every decision he made now. Even agreeing to go to war with the north would have severe
		consequences, and it was all for revenge.



		As clan leader, people were depending on him. Zhilin just hoped it would all be worth it.
