FIFTEEN YEARS LATER



Wedding preparations brought a festive atmosphere to the Dorina clan. Kalwen's granddaughter Melody was to wed
the heir of the Elessai clan tomorrow, and she wanted everything to be perfect for her granddaughter's big day.



The entire manor was full of decorations. Light blue streamers surrounded the walls and ceilings. It was
tradition for sky people to be wed in light blue colors, signifying that the marriage would be as eternal as the
sky. Everyone in attendance would wear white to represent the supporting clouds.



She went to check on Melody's dress. It was a gorgeous light blue, with elongated sleeves and silver seams. She
would be wearing a silver tiara atop her head, the same tiara Kalwen wore when she got married.



"Lady Dorina." Kalwen turned around to see Josemi Elessai approach her, her purple robes a sight to see amongst
the traditional blue of the Dorina clan. "Wow, the dress looks beautiful."



"Melody will look lovely," Kalwen agreed. "I trust your stay has been comfortable here?"



"Oh yes," Josemi assured. "It is always a pleasure visiting your clan."



Kalwen was a widowed clan leader, her husband having passed away long ago. She was the oldest clan leader in the
northern sky, nearing eighty years old. Josemi Elessai was still a somewhat young woman, likely in her thirties.
Now, they were going to become family.



"How is your son doing?" Kalwen asked. "Is he as excited as my Melody?"



Josemi laughed, although it sounded forced. "Astero is doing well. I'm sorry the marriage has been postponed for
so long. He wanted to be more situated with his duties as the next clan leader before marriage."



"Understandable," replied Kalwen. "They have been engaged for ten years. We wouldn't just call it off."



"I am grateful." Josemi smiled, although there was something behind it. Before Kalwen could say anything, a
messenger arrived.



He bowed to both of them before going up to Josemi and whispering in her ear. Kalwen could not hear a word he
said, but judging by the way Josemi's eyes widened, he did not bring good news.



"Ah, excuse me, Lady Dorina." Josemi looked flustered. "I must, um, see to something." Before Kalwen could
reply, Josemi left in a hurry with the messenger.



Kalwen didn't know what could be more important than the wedding preparations, but she supposed it was just
Josemi's own problem.



There was a festival outside the Dorina clan manor, and everywhere, the people were celebrating. Astero Elessai
and Melody Dorina were engaged since Astero was thirteen and Melody was nine. It was an arrangement between
Kalwen and Kairo. Kalwen suggested it after Kairo and Josemi announced the adoption of their son and proclaimed
him the heir to the Elessai clan. She believed it was in both of their favors to strengthen the unity of the
northern sky, whose relationship with the southern sky was nearing close to war. Among the five clans in the
north, Melody was closest to Astero in age, and both their clans were the largest.



Melody was the only daughter of Kalwen's deceased son and his wife. After they died from illness in one of the
coldest winters, Kalwen resumed the position of clan head and would lead until Melody's younger brother became
of age. It was not uncommon for women to lead in the Dorina clan, but Astero was Kairo and Josemi's only son, so
Melody would have to move there with him.



She would miss her granddaughter. Melody looked so much like her son, and she was all Kalwen had left of him
besides Aleksyn, Melody's younger brother. The wedding was bittersweet, but Kalwen knew Melody would be happy.



Kalwen has only met Astero once or twice. He was a handsome and kind man who looked like Josemi despite not
being blood related. The only facial feature that greatly differed were his eyes. Kalwen remembered them being
wide and innocent like a child's.



Truthfully, she did not know how Melody felt about him. She knew her granddaughter was excited to be married,
but Kalwen didn't know if that excitement came from marrying Astero or simply marrying someone. If it was the
latter, Kalwen still did not worry. She believed they would grow to love one another.



All around her, servants carried decorations and clothing. The altar had already been set up in the main room of
the manor, which was conveniently a church. The Dorina clan were very religious.



"My goodness, this will be the biggest wedding I've ever seen in my life."



Kalwen turned to see Yanni Lem, the former leader of the Lem clan, standing behind her. Being the only other
female clan leader in the northern sky many years ago, the two had once been great friends. However, politics
and family issues strained their friendship, and she was afraid Yanni was upset she did not choose to wed Melody
to one of her own grandsons.



Yanni wore the traditional green robes of the Lem clan, with a golden headpiece that was placed vertically on
top of her head rather than around it. A shiny red jewel crested her forehead.



"Yanni, it's been too long." She was almost as old as Kalwen, though her hair was still black which just a few
white strands. "How have you been?"



The Lem clan leader scowled. "Well enough. I feel for poor Melody, marrying that Elessai heir. He isn't even
blood related to them."



"He is their son," said Kalwen pointedly. "Blood relations do not matter."



"I'm surprised you can even think that." Yanni sounded disappointed.



Kalwen chose to ignore her words. "How is your daughter?"



"She could not be here," replied Yanni. "You know how busy it can be as a clan leader. She sent me in her stead.
I hope you are not offended."



"Not at all." Suna Lem was Yanni's daughter, as well as the new clan leader. She took over two years ago after
marrying a man from the Sallimo clan in the east. "I am happy to have you here, Yanni."



Yanni rolled her eyes, but there was hint of fondness in her features. "I'm sure you are."



Before they could say anything else, a messenger appeared. He looked flushed and out of breath, as if he had
been running all over the place.



"Lady Dorina. Lady Lem." He acknowledged them both with a bob of his head. "I have urgent news."



"Spit it out, then," said Yanni, looking bored.



He seemed hesitant to say.



"What is it?" Kalwen asked kindly. "Speak freely."



The messenger took a deep breath as if his whole body was in pain. "The Elessai clan heir has gone missing.
Everyone is currently out looking for him."



"Has he been kidnapped?" Kalwen asked in horror.



"We do not know," said the messenger. "We have guards to aid in the search. He has not turned up yet."



"The day before his wedding," Yanni mused. "How unfortunate."



Unlike Yanni, Kalwen was worried. "When was he last seen?"



"He was with Lord Elessai this morning." The messenger seemed to be doing his best to keep calm, but Kalwen saw
the panic on his face. "No one has seen him since."



"Well he can't have gone far," assured Kalwen. "The Dorina clan will help look as well."



"Thank you, Lady Dorina." He bowed profusely. "The Elessai will do our best to find him by today."



"And if you can't?" Yanni looked amused.



"I... I suppose the wedding will have to be postponed."



As news spread of Astero Elessai's disappearance, the festive occasion suddenly turned pensive. Kalwen thought
of her granddaughter, at how heartbroken she'd be, and prepared for the worst.
