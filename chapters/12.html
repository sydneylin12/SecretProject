		The instant sunlight illuminated the room through the windows, Josemi was wide awake. She cast a glance at Kairo
		beside her, still sound asleep. The light shined over his face, showing her how much he had aged over these
		years.



		Seventeen years ago, Josemi first met Kairo when he arrived in the eastern sky with hundreds of Elessai troops
		entering the towns and the Fen clan manor. She had been nineteen years old when the servants dressed her in sky
		blue wedding robes, placed a veil over her face, and presented her to him. He was older, taller, stronger, a
		stranger dressed in foreign purple colors coming to claim her. Josemi feared for her life, but if she refused,
		war would be brought to the Fen clan. They were skilled in martial arts, but the Elessai brought with them
		weapons of destruction. She could not refuse.



		Josemi remembered saying goodbye to her younger sisters and brothers. They had wept for her, pleaded for her not
		to leave. All she could do was embrace them tightly, for she did not know when she would see them again. Her
		father did not give her any words of parting. In fact, he hardly glanced her way as she left her home. Josemi
		knew he was trying his best to keep himself composed, so she said nothing to him either.



		It had been hard traveling over land, as the Fen clan created their territory over lakes, and boat was the
		primary mode of travel. They carried her in a palanquin, traipsing over the harsh land. She kept calm, did not
		weep, and did not speak.



		After many weeks, they had reached the northern sky. It was much colder, and Josemi felt as if she could barely
		breathe, though outwardly, she showed no sign of this. Her new husband led her inside. She felt his warm hand
		wrap around hers, gentler than she had imagined.



		She couldn't see his face clearly through the veil, so the first time she really looked at him was in their room
		when he lifted it off her. His eyes were dark and piercing, and his short brown hair was a mass of dark waves.
		His thin beard encompassed the bottom of his face, but his sharp cheekbones could clearly be seen. His golden
		bronze skin was darker than that of the Fen clan, and she wondered if the the sun reached Elessai territory
		often. Kairo Elessai gazed at her with his penetrative stare. He was handsome, but frightening.



		Despite being amazed by his appearance, Josemi showed none of this externally. She kept a blank face, giving
		nothing away.



		The first thing he had asked her was if she resented him. And she had said yes, because how could she not? From
		that day on, they had slept facing away from each other for a long time, and they would not speak to each other
		unless absolutely necessary.



		Over time, however, she began to see that he was the one waiting for her to open up to him. She had not let
		herself, as she despised him for taking her away from her family and threatening war on her people unless she
		married him. He was a stranger, Josemi had convinced herself, who claimed her for his own without remorse.



		But this stranger had given her all the space she needed. Whenever she asked for books from Fen writers or food
		from back home, he would have it done, all without a single word. He did not force Elessai education or customs
		on her when she did not want. He let her do whatever she pleased.



		And soon, she found that her heart had given just a tiny bit of space for him. She began to ask him questions
		about Elessai customs. She wore more purple in addition to the red of the Fen clan. She talked to him about her
		family over the dinner table. And he began to do the same for her.



		When Josemi found out she could not conceive a child, he had been the one to comfort her, to reassure her that
		she was not alone. And from then on, she had begun to truly love him.



		Who do you love more: your husband or your son?



		Josemi wondered if Kairo still loved her the way he used to. And she wondered if she still loved him the same
		way. Time brings people together, and time tears them apart.



		She would play a part in ruining this man in order to save Astero. To save her son, she would do a lot worse.



		Josemi did not wait for him to waken. She got out of bed and changed into her purple dress, long sleeves
		dangling low. She combed her long back hair and placed her golden laurel wreath crown atop her head. Josemi had
		grown used to seeing herself as an Elessai. What would become of her after Willow wreaked her vengeance? Would
		she be able to go back to the Fen clan, a place she hadn't visited in seventeen years?



		Kairo was still sound asleep, so Josemi quietly exited the room and headed downstairs where a breakfast feast
		was promised for all the guests by the Dorina clan. The dining hall walls were still covered in blue silks for
		the wedding, and Josemi internally cringed. When she arrived, the long table was already covered with platters
		of food, and Safiro Jourman and his wife, Yanni Lem and her husband, and Kalwen Dorina and her grandson were
		already eating. Melody Dorina was nowhere to be seen, and Josemi could hardly blame the poor girl who was going
		to be her daughter in law.



		"Lady Elessai," greeted Kalwen Dorina, seated at the head of the table. "Where is Lord Elessai?"



		"Still asleep, I'm afraid," replied Josemi, taking a seat next to Safiro Jourman.



		Yanni Lem laughed. "Out all night searching for your son, I take it?"



		Josemi gave a tense smile. Leave it to Lady Lem to address the elephant in the room. "Yes, indeed."



		"No sign of him?" Her voice sounded mocking.



		Josemi just shook her head, not wanting to speak to Yanni Lem any longer. When she was younger, she believed
		that if she had to marry into any clan from the northern sky, she had wanted to marry into the Lem clan rather
		than the Elessai clan due to their similar customs and similar-looking people to the Fen clan. However, after
		getting to know Yanni Lem, she was glad she didn't.



		"We've received information that it wasn't the south," assured Safiro Jourman. "The bad news is, we don't know
		who else it could be."



		"We're not even sure if he's been kidnapped," Yanni Lem piped in, her voice grating on Josemi's ears. "Maybe he
		just didn't want to marry poor little Melody."



		Josemi clenched her fists, trying not to give away the fact that Yanni was exactly right. She glanced at Kalwen
		Dorina who looked troubled.



		Before anyone could say anything, a man she had never seen before entered the room. He looked quite familiar,
		but she couldn't quite place it. He wore black trousers and a thin white button-up tunic with pink embroidered
		floral designs. The man smiled as he walked in, but there was something behind his dark eyes that was almost
		frightening. He was accompanied at the arm by a woman dressed in a long pink dress, her face stoic and
		uninterested.



		"Lord Ozario." Kalwen Dorina smiled in greeting, but it did not reach her eyes.



		"Lady Dorina." His voice was soft and elegant. "I apologize for my tardiness."



		"No harm done. Please, have a seat," she said, gesturing to two seats next to Josemi.



		They sat down, and Josemi finally realized why he looked so familiar. He was the spitting image of Darius Ozario
		whom Josemi had once met. He had been kind and welcoming when she and Kairo visited the Ozario clan many years
		ago. After his untimely death, she knew his son, Crisanto Ozario, had taken over as leader, but Josemi had never
		seen him.



		He sat down next to Josemi, and the woman sat down next to him.



		"We did not think you would show up," commented Yanni Lem. "You did not show up to recent clan leader meetings.
		What made this wedding so important?"



		"Forgive me," he replied, a plastic smile on his face. "For the last five years, I had been in mourning, and the
		Ozario clan had not been in a favorable state. I needed time to sort things out. I hope I did not offend any of
		you."



		"Of course not," assured Safiro Jourman. "I am sorry I could not be there for Darius' funeral." Josemi
		remembered that he and Darius Ozario had been close friends.



		"I am sorry as well," said Crisanto Ozario. "But alas, no harm done."



		"If there is anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask." Safiro Jourman sounded kind and genuine.



		It was just a split second, but Josemi could have sworn she saw Crisanto Ozario's friendly facade fall
		momentary. However, like a true clan leader, he simply smiled and said, "Thank you, Lord Jourman."



		No one but Josemi, who was seated right next to them, saw the woman place a hand on top of his, which Josemi
		realized was balled up into a fist.



		"You must be Lady Ozario," said Kalwen Dorina to the woman. "Are you enjoying your stay?"



		She nodded, expression still blank. "It has been... interesting."



		"I hope that's a good thing." Kalwen Dorina smiled.



		Lady Ozario smiled back, but it looked tense. She said nothing in reply.



		The atmosphere at the table was strangely uncomfortable, and Josemi desperately wanted to leave.



		While everyone was conversing amongst themselves, Crisanto Ozario leaned over to Josemi. "My sympathies for the
		disappearance of your son, Lady Elessai," he murmured.



		Josemi stiffened. "Ah, thank you, Lord Ozario. We are doing the best we can to find him."



		He smiled. "I sure hope he is safe. The ground is a dangerous place."



		Her eyes widened. "How do you - "



		He gave her a look that clearly meant for her to be quieter. "We will begin looking for him today."



		"Are you working with Willow?"



		Crisanto Ozario did not answer. He just said, "Give my best to Lord Elessai." Then, he stood up, and he and his
		wife left the dining hall without a word.
