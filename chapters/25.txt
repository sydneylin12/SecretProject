Kona had genuinely believed her devotion to Lord Ozario and Lady Willow wou=
ld outweigh her fear of the ground. She had been been wrong.=20

The moment Kona came into contact with another person, she immediately ran =
back to the forest that hid the staircase, crouching next to a tree to catc=
h her breath. She placed a heavy hand over her heart and tried to calm hers=
elf, but it did little to ease her panic.=20

She chided herself for being so pathetic. Lady Willow and Lord Ozario were =
depending on her to find Astero Elessai. And yet, why wouldn't her hands st=
op trembling?=20

Kona had been trained in the art of stealth and assassination by Lady Willo=
w herself. She had once killed a man who tried to take advantage of her by =
slowly slicing at bits and pieces of his body. Kona was not afraid of peopl=
e in the sky.=20

However, those on the ground were a mystery. Like all people living in the =
sky, she had heard the stories. They were monsters, disguised as humans. Th=
ey would feast on the flesh and bones of each other, and when a sky person =
descended, they would rip them apart. Kona had volunteered for this mission=
 knowing all this, but the moment she stepped foot on the ground, fear over=
whelmed her. And when she laid eyes on a ground person, she fled like a cow=
ard.=20

The staircase was just beyond the trees. She could use the paralysis needle=
s and ascend back to the sky. She could tell Lord Ozario and Lady Willow th=
e truth: that Kona had underestimated how terrifying the ground would be.=
=20

Kona groaned, burying her face in her knees as she leaned against a tree, d=
igging her nails into her hands hard enough to leave marks. She wanted to s=
cream, but the guards would hear her. She felt like a child, clutching onto=
 Lady Willow like her life depended on it.=20

They were counting on her. But Kona was so, so scared.=20

Ground people were stronger, fiercer, more ruthless. How could she possibly=
 survive?=20

Kona took a few more deep breaths. Then, she took out the knife hidden in h=
er shawl and sliced open her forearm, blood instantly seeping out of the wo=
und. She hissed, but the pain felt better than the fear. She focused on the=
 blood spilling onto the forest floor, watching the dirt and leaves stain r=
ed.=20

Blood calmed her. It mesmerized her. Its rich, vibrant color, so beautiful =
and hypnotizing. The smell, metallic and sharp, worked like anesthesia on K=
ona, relaxing her entire body. She wanted to drown in the feeling.=20

Kona cut her forearm again right next to the first wound, and the more bloo=
d she saw, the calmer she felt. Kona wished she could cut open her entire b=
ody and let all the blood flow out.=20

Focusing on her bleeding forearm, Kona stood, shaking slightly less than be=
fore. She put one foot in front of the other, steps quiet through the fores=
t. Eyes still on the blood dripping down her arm, Kona walked until she mad=
e it out of the forest, reaching the hill where the village lay just ahead.=
=20

There were people close to the fence separating the village from the outski=
rts. They wore commoners' clothing, picking flowers from the ground and fru=
its from trees. Why did they have need for such novel things? What use did =
monsters have for them?=20

'Focus on the blood.'=20

She cut another slice into her forearm and watched the blood fall. Kona ste=
eled her expression, hardened her gaze, tried to look enough like one of th=
em. She focused on the overwhelming smell of blood.=20

"E - Excuse me!" Kona called, walking slowly towards them.=20

They all turned to look up at her, and she almost recoiled in fear.=20

"I - I'm... uh..."=20

They looked at each other for a moment, until one person, a small old woman=
 with gray hair and strangely kind eyes, stepped forward. "Are you lost?"=
=20

Kona gazed directly at the blood on her arm while replying. "Yes, and I'm l=
ooking for someone." Her voice came out shaky and quiet.=20

"Celeste, she's bleeding," pointed out another woman.=20

Instinctively, Kona hid her arm behind her back, afraid the monsters would =
be attracted to the scent of her blood.=20

"I can help you," said the old woman, smiling gently. "I'm a doctor."=20

Kona reeled back. She had to be lying. Ground people weren't doctors.=20

The old woman, sending Kona's skepticism, took a step back. "Please don't b=
e afraid. I've been a doctor for years."=20

"You're lying!" Kona blurted out, then immediately shut her mouth. She had =
just offended this monster. It was going to attack her at any moment.=20

The woman, as well as the rest of the people, glanced worriedly at one anot=
her. Kona was rooted to her spot, trembling in fear, unable to focus on her=
 bloody arm to keep calm.=20

"What makes you think that?" the woman asked slowly.=20

Kona did not know what to say. She tried to slow her breathing, but that on=
ly rapidly increased it.=20

"I'm..." Kona swallowed. "I'm not afraid of you."=20

"That's good." The woman smiled, and for a moment, Kona's defenses dropped.=
 "I want you to trust me. Can I take a look at your arm?"=20

Kona brought up her arm from behind her, red-stained and trembling. She was=
 close to passing out. Three cuts was too many, especially with how deep sh=
e made them, but Kona was too nervous to cut any shallower.=20

The woman took a step towards Kona. "Do you trust me?"=20

In all honesty, Kona wanted to. She was close to passing out and would even=
tually have no choice but to leave her life in the hands of these monsters.=
 Kona was usually careful about these cuts, but being on the ground made he=
r unsteady, which was shameful for a disciple of Willow Ozario.=20

She shook her head. "I..."=20

Before she knew it, Kona was falling forward, landing on the ground like a =
broken statue, feeling her resolve shatter into pieces.=20

There were shouts all around her, and Kona felt herself being carried in so=
meone's arms. A man was holding her. Another monster.=20

"I'll treat her in the village," said the old woman, placing a gentle hand =
on Kona's arm.=20

"Let go of me," she mumbled weakly, struggling pointlessly. She could feel =
her eyes drifting to a close, and Kona forced them to remain open and alert=
.

"What's your name, dear?" asked the woman as they walked closer to the vill=
age.=20

Kona did not have the time to answer, for her consciousness had already sli=
pped away.=20

When she awoke next, she was lying in a bed, feeling weak and dizzy. She sa=
t up with a start, reaching for the knife hidden in her shawl... only to re=
alize the shawl had been taken from her.=20

There was no time to panic. Kona needed to find the shawl and slip out of t=
his place unnoticed. She shuffled out of bed, lightly pressing her feet aga=
inst the floor so as not to make a sound, controlling her breathing to be a=
s silent as possible.

Suddenly, footsteps sounded right outside the door, and Kona leaped on the =
other side of the bed, hiding behind the frame. She ceased all breathing as=
 someone stepped inside.=20

Kona heard the person sigh. "I brought food for you. You lost a lot of bloo=
d, so eat to gain your strength back."=20

It wasn't until now that Kona realized her arms had been bandaged up.=20

"Are you in here?" The voice seemed quieter, more unsure.=20

Kona did not move.=20

"I don't know why you're scared of us," said the woman, her voice gentle, "=
but all we want is to take care of you. I hope you can believe me."=20

Kona did not say a word.=20

"My name is Celeste." The bed dipped as the woman took a seat at the edge. =
Kona gripped the side railing, her fingers turning white. "Would you tell m=
e your name?"=20

The woman turned around and peered over the bed, right at Kona's crouching =
form. Kona moved faster than she thought possible, as if a rush of wind car=
ried her arms forward, guiding her hands around the woman's neck. She pinne=
d her against the bed, but for some reason, Kona couldn't bring herself to =
squeeze any tighter.=20

Those eyes were not the eyes of a monster, as much as Kona tried to deny it=
. They gazed at her softly and sincerely, as if Kona were a small, innocent=
 child. Lady Willow cared for her, but she also pushed her to her limits, t=
raining Kona, preparing her for the worst. She would be disappointed and an=
gry when Kona did something wrong, just like a mother.=20

But this woman looked at her as if she could never do any wrong, even thoug=
h in one second, Kona could squeeze the breath out of her.=20

It hit her all of a sudden, like a bolt of lightning striking her heart. Wi=
th shaking hands, Kona pulled herself off the old woman, Celeste, and sat b=
ack on the bed, breathing heavily.=20

Celeste sat up slowly, a sad smile on her face. "I apologize if I startled =
you."=20

Kona shook her head, feeling too ashamed to look at her.=20

"You must have been through a lot."=20

"What is wrong with you?" Kona demanded.=20

Celeste seemed confused. "What do you mean?"

"I just... I don't understand. Why are you taking care of me?"=20

"I'm a doctor," replied Celeste, as if that was explanation enough. "I trea=
t all people. You are a person, aren't you?"=20

'A person?'

Perhaps Lady Willow and Lord Ozario made a mistake. Perhaps they had led he=
r down a different set of stairs that simply led to another part of the sky=
. People on the ground weren't actually people.=20

But there was a person right in front of Kona.=20

"...Thank you, Celeste."=20

The old woman's eyes widened with delight. She smiled, and all the tension =
in Kona dissipated. "Would you like some lunch?"=20

Kona felt strong enough to walk, and so the two of them headed to the dinin=
g hall. They appeared to be in a large hospital, and Kona noticed other peo=
ple with a variety of injuries. What need would the monsters on the ground =
have for treating one another? Unless she had been wrong the entire time, a=
nd they weren't monsters. They were just like people in the sky.=20

Celeste led Kona to a small wooden table, where a few people were already e=
ating. Kona sat at the very end, and Celeste remained standing. Immediately=
, all eyes were on her. Kona noticed that they all seemed to be around her =
age.=20

"This is a new patient," introduced Celeste. "Be nice, and don't ask anythi=
ng personal."=20

"Yes, ma'am," replied one of the boys, smiling brightly at her.=20

She walked over to his side and pinched his cheek affectionately. Kona felt=
 her heart lurch at the sight, for how could monsters care for one another =
like this? Growing up as an orphan on the streets of the Sanu clan, she was=
 often scorned and turned away, treated like a pest. The Sanu valued streng=
th and did not take too kindly to weaklings. Kona did not know what it mean=
t to care for someone until she met Lady Willow. How could it be possible t=
hat the people of the Sanu seemed more like monsters than the people on the=
 ground?=20

"So where you from?" asked one of the boys, his eyes wide and curious.

One of the girls slapped his arm. "Celeste said to not ask anything persona=
l."=20

"That's not personal!" he protested.=20

"Ignore him," said the girl, smiling at Kona. Her skin was dark like the pe=
ople of the Jourman clan, with black hair and dark brown eyes. But her smil=
e reminded Kona of Zonem, who was the sweetest person she knew.=20

"Kisani!" the boy whined.=20

"I'm Kisani," she said, continuing to ignore him. "And this is Damien, Minn=
ie, and Lawrence. You don't have to tell us your name if you don't want to.=
"=20

"I'm Kona," Kona replied quietly. It wasn't her real name, anyway. She did =
not know her real name.=20

"You here for arm injuries?" asked Lawrence, the boy who had his cheeks pin=
ched by Celeste.=20

Kona looked down at her arms that were wrapped in bandages. Celeste must ha=
ve treated her. Kona was becoming more convinced that the staircase simply =
led to another part of the sky. There was no way people on the ground could=
 be this kind.=20

And so, Kona felt more comfortable. She smiled along with their jokes, and =
even learned she was the same age as Kisani. Damien and Kisani would consta=
ntly bicker, Lawrence would joke around with everyone, and Minnie, a fourte=
en year old girl who looked like she was a member of the Priyavansu clan, s=
at quietly, but she seemed to be enjoying herself nonetheless.=20

Kona never had many friends. She spent most of her days with Lady Willow, t=
raining in the art of assassination. The only person she met her age recent=
ly was Melody Dorina, and that did not turn out well.=20

She felt safe here.=20

"Kona, let's get more food!" suggested Lawrence, already standing up.=20

The once renowned and feared assassin of the Sanu clan smiled and hurriedly=
 followed after him.

She had been been wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The moment Kona came into contact with another person, she immediately ran back to the forest that hid the staircase, crouching next to a tree to catch her breath. She placed a heavy hand over her heart and tried to calm herself, but it did little to ease her panic.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She chided herself for being so pathetic. Lady Willow and Lord Ozario were depending on her to find Astero Elessai. And yet, why wouldn't her hands stop trembling?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona had been trained in the art of stealth and assassination by Lady Willow herself. She had once killed a man who tried to take advantage of her by slowly slicing at bits and pieces of his body. Kona was not afraid of people in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">However, those on the ground were a mystery. Like all people living in the sky, she had heard the stories. They were monsters, disguised as humans. They would feast on the flesh and bones of each other, and when a sky person descended, they would rip them apart. Kona had volunteered for this mission knowing all this, but the moment she stepped foot on the ground, fear overwhelmed her. And when she laid eyes on a ground person, she fled like a coward.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The staircase was just beyond the trees. She could use the paralysis needles and ascend back to the sky. She could tell Lord Ozario and Lady Willow the truth: that Kona had underestimated how terrifying the ground would be.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona groaned, burying her face in her knees as she leaned against a tree, digging her nails into her hands hard enough to leave marks. She wanted to scream, but the guards would hear her. She felt like a child, clutching onto Lady Willow like her life depended on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">They were counting on her. But Kona was so, so scared.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Ground people were stronger, fiercer, more ruthless. How could she possibly survive?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona took a few more deep breaths. Then, she took out the knife hidden in her shawl and sliced open her forearm, blood instantly seeping out of the wound. She hissed, but the pain felt better than the fear. She focused on the blood spilling onto the forest floor, watching the dirt and leaves stain red.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Blood calmed her. It mesmerized her. Its rich, vibrant color, so beautiful and hypnotizing. The smell, metallic and sharp, worked like anesthesia on Kona, relaxing her entire body. She wanted to drown in the feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona cut her forearm again right next to the first wound, and the more blood she saw, the calmer she felt. Kona wished she could cut open her entire body and let all the blood flow out.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Focusing on her bleeding forearm, Kona stood, shaking slightly less than before. She put one foot in front of the other, steps quiet through the forest. Eyes still on the blood dripping down her arm, Kona walked until she made it out of the forest, reaching the hill where the village lay just ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">There were people close to the fence separating the village from the outskirts. They wore commoners' clothing, picking flowers from the ground and fruits from trees. Why did they have need for such novel things? What use did monsters have for them?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">'Focus on the blood.'&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She cut another slice into her forearm and watched the blood fall. Kona steeled her expression, hardened her gaze, tried to look enough like one of them. She focused on the overwhelming smell of blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"E - Excuse me!" Kona called, walking slowly towards them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">They all turned to look up at her, and she almost recoiled in fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I - I'm... uh..."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">They looked at each other for a moment, until one person, a small old woman with gray hair and strangely kind eyes, stepped forward. "Are you lost?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona gazed directly at the blood on her arm while replying. "Yes, and I'm looking for someone." Her voice came out shaky and quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Celeste, she's bleeding," pointed out another woman.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Instinctively, Kona hid her arm behind her back, afraid the monsters would be attracted to the scent of her blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I can help you," said the old woman, smiling gently. "I'm a doctor."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona reeled back. She had to be lying. Ground people weren't doctors.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The old woman, sending Kona's skepticism, took a step back. "Please don't be afraid. I've been a doctor for years."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You're lying!" Kona blurted out, then immediately shut her mouth. She had just offended this monster. It was going to attack her at any moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The woman, as well as the rest of the people, glanced worriedly at one another. Kona was rooted to her spot, trembling in fear, unable to focus on her bloody arm to keep calm.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What makes you think that?" the woman asked slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona did not know what to say. She tried to slow her breathing, but that only rapidly increased it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm..." Kona swallowed. "I'm not afraid of you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"That's good." The woman smiled, and for a moment, Kona's defenses dropped. "I want you to trust me. Can I take a look at your arm?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona brought up her arm from behind her, red-stained and trembling. She was close to passing out. Three cuts was too many, especially with how deep she made them, but Kona was too nervous to cut any shallower.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The woman took a step towards Kona. "Do you trust me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">In all honesty, Kona wanted to. She was close to passing out and would eventually have no choice but to leave her life in the hands of these monsters. Kona was usually careful about these cuts, but being on the ground made her unsteady, which was shameful for a disciple of Willow Ozario.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She shook her head. "I..."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Before she knew it, Kona was falling forward, landing on the ground like a broken statue, feeling her resolve shatter into pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">There were shouts all around her, and Kona felt herself being carried in someone's arms. A man was holding her. Another monster.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'll treat her in the village," said the old woman, placing a gentle hand on Kona's arm.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Let go of me," she mumbled weakly, struggling pointlessly. She could feel her eyes drifting to a close, and Kona forced them to remain open and alert.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What's your name, dear?" asked the woman as they walked closer to the village.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona did not have the time to answer, for her consciousness had already slipped away.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">When she awoke next, she was lying in a bed, feeling weak and dizzy. She sat up with a start, reaching for the knife hidden in her shawl... only to realize the shawl had been taken from her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">There was no time to panic. Kona needed to find the shawl and slip out of this place unnoticed. She shuffled out of bed, lightly pressing her feet against the floor so as not to make a sound, controlling her breathing to be as silent as possible.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Suddenly, footsteps sounded right outside the door, and Kona leaped on the other side of the bed, hiding behind the frame. She ceased all breathing as someone stepped inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona heard the person sigh. "I brought food for you. You lost a lot of blood, so eat to gain your strength back."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">It wasn't until now that Kona realized her arms had been bandaged up.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Are you in here?" The voice seemed quieter, more unsure.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona did not move.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I don't know why you're scared of us," said the woman, her voice gentle, "but all we want is to take care of you. I hope you can believe me."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona did not say a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"My name is Celeste." The bed dipped as the woman took a seat at the edge. Kona gripped the side railing, her fingers turning white. "Would you tell me your name?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The woman turned around and peered over the bed, right at Kona's crouching form. Kona moved faster than she thought possible, as if a rush of wind carried her arms forward, guiding her hands around the woman's neck. She pinned her against the bed, but for some reason, Kona couldn't bring herself to squeeze any tighter.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Those eyes were not the eyes of a monster, as much as Kona tried to deny it. They gazed at her softly and sincerely, as if Kona were a small, innocent child. Lady Willow cared for her, but she also pushed her to her limits, training Kona, preparing her for the worst. She would be disappointed and angry when Kona did something wrong, just like a mother.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">But this woman looked at her as if she could never do any wrong, even though in one second, Kona could squeeze the breath out of her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">It hit her all of a sudden, like a bolt of lightning striking her heart. With shaking hands, Kona pulled herself off the old woman, Celeste, and sat back on the bed, breathing heavily.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Celeste sat up slowly, a sad smile on her face. "I apologize if I startled you."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona shook her head, feeling too ashamed to look at her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You must have been through a lot."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"What is wrong with you?" Kona demanded.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Celeste seemed confused. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I just... I don't understand. Why are you taking care of me?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm a doctor," replied Celeste, as if that was explanation enough. "I treat all people. You are a person, aren't you?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">'A person?'</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Perhaps Lady Willow and Lord Ozario made a mistake. Perhaps they had led her down a different set of stairs that simply led to another part of the sky. People on the ground weren't actually people.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">But there was a person right in front of Kona.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"...Thank you, Celeste."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The old woman's eyes widened with delight. She smiled, and all the tension in Kona dissipated. "Would you like some lunch?"&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona felt strong enough to walk, and so the two of them headed to the dining hall. They appeared to be in a large hospital, and Kona noticed other people with a variety of injuries. What need would the monsters on the ground have for treating one another? Unless she had been wrong the entire time, and they weren't monsters. They were just like people in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Celeste led Kona to a small wooden table, where a few people were already eating. Kona sat at the very end, and Celeste remained standing. Immediately, all eyes were on her. Kona noticed that they all seemed to be around her age.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"This is a new patient," introduced Celeste. "Be nice, and don't ask anything personal."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Yes, ma'am," replied one of the boys, smiling brightly at her.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She walked over to his side and pinched his cheek affectionately. Kona felt her heart lurch at the sight, for how could monsters care for one another like this? Growing up as an orphan on the streets of the Sanu clan, she was often scorned and turned away, treated like a pest. The Sanu valued strength and did not take too kindly to weaklings. Kona did not know what it meant to care for someone until she met Lady Willow. How could it be possible that the people of the Sanu seemed more like monsters than the people on the ground?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"So where you from?" asked one of the boys, his eyes wide and curious.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">One of the girls slapped his arm. "Celeste said to not ask anything personal."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"That's not personal!" he protested.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Ignore him," said the girl, smiling at Kona. Her skin was dark like the people of the Jourman clan, with black hair and dark brown eyes. But her smile reminded Kona of Zonem, who was the sweetest person she knew.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Kisani!" the boy whined.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm Kisani," she said, continuing to ignore him. "And this is Damien, Minnie, and Lawrence. You don't have to tell us your name if you don't want to."&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"I'm Kona," Kona replied quietly. It wasn't her real name, anyway. She did not know her real name.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"You here for arm injuries?" asked Lawrence, the boy who had his cheeks pinched by Celeste.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona looked down at her arms that were wrapped in bandages. Celeste must have treated her. Kona was becoming more convinced that the staircase simply led to another part of the sky. There was no way people on the ground could be this kind.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">And so, Kona felt more comfortable. She smiled along with their jokes, and even learned she was the same age as Kisani. Damien and Kisani would constantly bicker, Lawrence would joke around with everyone, and Minnie, a fourteen year old girl who looked like she was a member of the Priyavansu clan, sat quietly, but she seemed to be enjoying herself nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">Kona never had many friends. She spent most of her days with Lady Willow, training in the art of assassination. The only person she met her age recently was Melody Dorina, and that did not turn out well.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">She felt safe here.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">"Kona, let's get more food!" suggested Lawrence, already standing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18); min-height: 20.5px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal; font-family: Georgia; color: rgb(18, 18, 18);">The once renowned and feared assassin of the Sanu clan smiled and hurriedly followed after him.</p><br><div dir="ltr">Sent from my iPhone</div></body></html>
