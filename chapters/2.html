		Chapter 2
	</h1>
<p class="w3-display-middle">
The Ozario clan was a powerful clan with tremendous influence among the sky people. Darius Ozario, the leader of
the clan, was a charismatic and beloved man. His wife, Maeryn, was a socialite with many friends across the
various clans. They had a daughter, Rosella, who only knew compassion and kindness, as taught by her parents.



She loved adventuring outside, and she made her way to the gardens near the edge of her clan's territory. It was
springtime, and the roses were in full bloom, their radiance brighter than the morning sun. Rosella strolled
along the pathway, marveling at the flowers all around her.



Then, all of a sudden, she heard a shout, followed by running. It was getting closer and closer to her, and then
it stopped. Rosella saw a young boy, his clothes torn and dirty, his black hair grimy and tangled. The boy
stopped running. As if content with getting caught by the guard chasing him, he looked to the sky and smiled.



A million thoughts ran through her head in a single moment. A guard was chasing after this boy. Perhaps he
committed a crime of some sort. They were so close to the stairway, maybe he climbed up from the ground. Either
way, he was just a child, and she could not bear to see him punished. Despite his impending doom, he looked so
happy just seeing the sunrise, his dark eyes full of wonder.



Rosella made a choice in that instant. She ran up to him and grabbed his arm. She mistakenly made eye contact
with the guard running towards them, but she didn't have time to worry about that. Rosella tugged the boy's arm
and ran as fast as she could.



The two of them passed by tall trees and houses, passed the river that ran through this part of the land, all
the way to Rosella's home. However, she knew the guard recognized her, so instead, she went to the bustling town
near her home instead.



She pulled the boy with her into an area between two houses, then took a deep breath, leading against the wall.
Rosella hadn't run that hard in her life.



Finally, when she caught her breath, Rosella looked at the boy. He did not looked frightened, just curious.



"Hello," she decided to say, giving him a friendly smile.



The boy smiled back, albeit a bit awkwardly.



"What is your name?" she asked.



"I don't know," he replied.



"You don't have a name?"



He shook his head.



"I am Rosella," she said. "It is nice to meet you."



He said nothing.



"Can I ask why that guard was chasing you?"



The boy looked at the ground, not daring to meet her eyes. "I'm not supposed to be here. I'm from the ground."



"You climbed all the way up?"



He nodded.



Whenever Rosella looked at the stairway, it made her dizzy just how far down it went. She had never been to the
ground, but judging by the endless spiral of the staircase, it would be a long trip for anybody. And yet, this
small boy managed to climb it all by himself. She couldn't help but feel amazed.



"Why did you do it?" He had to have known the risk, the consequences.



Like before, the boy looked to the sky. The sky reflected in those dark eyes of his. "I wanted to see the
clouds."



"You came all the way here just for that?"



"I can't see them clearly on the ground."



The way he said that made her heart lurch. Clouds always surrounded her, no matter where she went. The vast sky
spread out before her, clear as it could be. She never imagined that because of her land and her people, they
could not see the view she saw every day.



"How old are you?" Rosella asked.



"Eight," he replied.



She believed him, but she also thought he looked younger, perhaps due to malnutrition. The boy was short and
thin. What kind of life did he have on the ground?



"What about you?" It was the first question he asked her.



"Thirteen," she said. "You may call me Anle, if you'd like."



"I thought your name was Rosella."



"In my clan, Anle is used to address an older girl, such as someone you view as an older sister." It was
different for other clans, and some did not have any such honorifics, but in the Ozario clan, Anle was for older
girls, and Soro was for older boys.



However, it occurred to Rosella that putting her own clan's values on this young boy was presumptuous of her. So
she quickly said, "You don't have to, though! You may call me Rosella, I don't mind."



He shrugged. "It's okay. I can call you Anle."



Rosella was the youngest in her family, having two older siblings. It felt nice to be the older one for a
change, and she couldn't help but smile.



Suddenly, Rosella heard shouts coming from the streets, followed by the march of guards. She grabbed the boy's
hand again, and together, they ran through the back alleys of the town, heading straight for the forest nearby,
going further and further away from Ozario clan territory.



She did not have time to think as she ran. Rosella focused on what was right in front of her. The only way she
could tell the boy was still with her was her grip on his small hand.



They ran through the grassy fields, past the occasional house and farm along the way. They did not stop running
until they entered the forest, and then, Rosella slowed to a walking pace.



She looked behind her and saw the boy, not even out of breath.



"Sorry," she said. "Are you tired?"



He shook his head. "I'm okay. I run a lot."



She took in his appearance, and it suddenly dawned on her that he wasn't even wearing shoes. He had run all that
way barefoot.



"Oh, I'm so sorry!" She crouched down to get a better look at his feet. "Are you hurt? I didn't even notice!"



"I don't have shoes."



"Here, you can wear mine." Rosella slipped off her flats and placed them in front of him.



The boy slipped his feet into her shoes. They were slightly too big for him, but he shyly said, "Thank you,
Anle." His face turned red, as if not used to such kindness.



Rosella smiled. "Of course! Now, we have to think of what to call you. Your parents never gave you a name?"



"I don't have parents. I'm an orphan."



"Well, then you can name yourself! What do you want to be called?"



"I don't know. You choose."



"A name is really important," Rosella explained. "It should be something you like."



He just shook his head helplessly. "I don't know."



"It's okay, you can think about it." Rosella took his hand. "Come on, let's go to the meadow nearby."



The two walked through the forest, Rosella feeling the soil beneath her feet. They came upon a clearing, where
there was a field of flowers bathing underneath the morning sun.



She looked at the boy, and his eyes were brighter than ever before. There was a hint of a smile on his face, his
skin glowing.



"Pretty, right?" Rosella picked up a flower and handed it to the boy.



He nodded excitedly, taking the flower from her hands. He studied it carefully, then put it to his nose and took
in a deep breath.



"That kind of flower is an aster," she explained. It was bright lavender, with thin petals fanning out. "Asters
like to grow under lots of sunlight."



The boy gazed at the flower, as if mesmerized by it.



"Do you want more?" Rosella picked up a different flower. "This one's a rose. They're my favorite." She handed
this one to the boy as well. He held the two flowers in his grasp, and the joy on his face filled Rosella's
heart with warmth.



Together, the two of them walked around the field, Rosella explaining to him the different types of flowers. The
boy barely spoke the entire time, but he was always attentive, listening to every word she said. She did not
give him any more flowers, but he didn't seem to mind. He seemed satisfied with just the aster and the rose.



After a while, as the two sat in the field of flowers silently, the boy asked, "Are you going to turn me in?"



Rosella looked at him, his expression vulnerable, and she shook her head. "Of course not."



"Why?" He seemed genuinely confused.



"You want to live here, don't you? If I turned you in, they'd send you back to the ground."



"So I can stay here?"



"If that's what you'd like, then yes."



"Forever?"



She nodded.



His face broke out into a smile, and he threw himself into Rosella's arms. "Thank you, Anle! Thank you!"



Rosella laughed. "You're very welcome." She didn't know how she'd find a way to let him stay, but he looked so
happy at the moment, she didn't want to say any more. She would find a way. She had to.



"At night, can you see the stars?" he asked, wide-eyed.



"Of course! Did you know that there are more stars than flowers?"



"Really?" he breathed.



And so when night fell, Rosella showed him all the constellations she knew. He marveled at how vast the sky was,
how there were more worlds out there besides their own. He listened to Rosella speak about galaxies and planets,
and she never grew tired of teaching him.



Then, the two of them fell asleep outside in the field of flowers, underneath the night sky.
