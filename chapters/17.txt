Several days had passed since Astero and Rosella went on their first job to=
gether. Since then, he made sure to accompany her to any job she had, helpi=
ng her as much as he could. Rosella had insisted on giving him some of the =
profits, but he always refused, stating that he simply wanted to help.=20

The truth was, Astero was more tired than he had ever been in his whole lif=
e. Rosella worked every day, usually from morning until evening. Back home,=
 the servants would prepare his meals, clean his chambers, and wash his clo=
thes, among many other things. All he had to do was attend his lessons on m=
athematics, literature, music, art, history, and politics for the first par=
t of the day, and then he could do whatever he wanted. Since arriving in th=
e sky, Astero never had to work. That was just another thing he was indebte=
d to Rosella for.=20

It had actually gotten to the point where, this morning, he had woken up wi=
th a fever.=20

"Oh, you poor thing," cooed Rosella, wiping his forehead with washcloth. "I=
t must have been all the heat and working out in the sun all day."=20

Astero just lay there, too tired to speak. His own breath rushed in his ear=
s, and his entire body felt plastered in place. How pathetic he was to have=
 to be taken care of like a child.=20

"I'll get you some food," Rosella said softly, standing up to leave.=20

"I'm sorry," he mumbled, shutting his eyes. He hated how utterly helpless h=
e was.=20

Rosella laughed lightly. "Sorry again?"=20

He nodded weakly.=20

She sighed, placing a cooling hand against his forehead. "Don't push yourse=
lf. You're not used to exerting yourself this much."=20

Astero only hummed in response.=20

"I'll be back. Just rest." Then Rosella left the room.=20

The two of them were supposed to go on another job today. Some rich men fro=
m the next town over were visiting to discuss renovations for the village i=
n the banquet hall, and he and Rosella, along with a few others, were hired=
 to serve them food and attend to their needs. However, at the moment, Aste=
ro could barely attend to his own needs, much less the needs of others.=20

He had come down to the ground with the sole purpose of repaying his debt t=
o Rosella. And yet, besides accompanying her on jobs, Astero had done nothi=
ng for her. She was still working as much as ever, still cooking and cleani=
ng for Jayda, still looking after him during his useless moments. Perhaps h=
is efforts were futile.=20

Rosella came back in with a bowl of steaming hot soup, and hated himself ev=
en more. How dare he trouble her like this.=20

"Why do you look so disgusted?" asked Rosella jokingly. "I promise you, Jay=
da didn't make it."=20

He shook his head and sighed. "I'm pathetic."=20

"Have you never gotten sick before?" she asked incredulously.=20

"Probably, but it never felt this bad."=20

"Well, when one is sick, it's normal for someone else to take care of them.=
" Rosella kneeled down beside his mat on the floor and set down the bowl. "=
So stop worrying, please."=20

After a few spoonfuls of soup, fed to him like a child by Rosella, Astero f=
elt himself drift in and out of consciousness.=20

He woke up groggily, unaware of how much time had passed. Astero looked aro=
und the room before realizing Rosella was no longer by his bedside. He sat =
up with a start, panic setting in. How long had he slept? Did she really le=
ave for the job without him? How could he just lay there in bed while she w=
as out working hard and simultaneously caring for him? He might as well jus=
t go back to the sky at that point and marry Melody as punishment.=20

The very thought scared him so much he nearly felt sick again. He cursed hi=
s own cowardice.=20

The door slowly opened, and Rosella peeked in. Seeing that he was awake, sh=
e exclaimed, "Oh, you look better!"=20

Astero sighed with relief. "You're here."=20

"Of course I am." She kneeled by his side and placed the back of her hand a=
gainst his forehead. "Still a bit warm," Rosella said, concerned. "Are you =
comfortable?"=20

He hesitated. The truth was, his back ached from discomfort. He had been st=
ruggling to sleep at night, and whenever he woke up in the morning, his sho=
ulders and back nearly destroyed him.=20

Rosella must have seen the hesitation in his features because her expressio=
n grew increasingly worried. "You aren't." Then, her face suddenly lit up, =
her eyes sparkling. "You can rest in my bed instead!"=20

That was the last thing he wanted. If he stayed in her bed, she would be th=
e one sleeping on the hard floor, and Astero would rather sleep on the floo=
r forever than have her suffer this way. He shook his head fiercely. "No, I=
'm fine here."=20

"You're clearly not," she pointed out, unamused. "I'm going out anyway. You=
 need to be in bed all day, so you might as well stay in mine."=20

So she was still going to the job without him. He couldn't just tell her no=
t to go. That was how she had been making a living all these years. Besides=
, he could barely move at the moment. He was no use to her.=20

However, he still refused to stay in her bed, insisting that he did not wan=
t infect her room. She had just rolled her eyes but did not argue. After ma=
king sure he had enough food and water by his bedside, Rosella left the hou=
se, leaving Astero lying in his bed, feeling worse than ever.=20

Ever since he visited the Fen clan with his mother when he was just fifteen=
 years old, Astero had been using their signature paralysis needles to desc=
end the stairway time and time again. He would tell his parents he was leav=
ing on a trip somewhere, and then he'd go to the ground in search of Rosell=
a. He visited many towns and many villages, wandering around for years and =
years. He had stumbled upon places Rosella had actually stayed, where the p=
eople had known her. Most of them said crude things about her, but Astero p=
aid them no mind. His only goal was to find her, and all his searching had =
not been futile. A few days before his wedding, Astero had received informa=
tion that she was living in a village in the north called Onen, quite a way=
s away from the northern stairway, but not too far that he couldn't reach i=
t within a few hours. The day before his wedding, he decided to set out and=
 find her once and for all. Astero knew it would cause a commotion, but he =
couldn't find it in himself to care. And when he found her, all he wanted w=
as to repay her for giving him the life he had dreamed of.=20

He had wondered what he would say to her the moment he found her. Astero ha=
d been apologizing profusely, and Rosella found it amusing, but she always =
believed he apologized for the littlest things. She didn't know what he had=
 truly done. No amount of apologizing could be enough.=20

Twenty-three years of living, and most of it was spent in the sky thanks to=
 her. He would probably have forgotten what life was like on the ground if =
he hadn't been imagining Rosella experiencing it for fifteen years. It haun=
ted his dreams, clawing away at his mind. The guilt weighed on his shoulder=
s, constantly reminding Astero that he was a horrible, horrible person.=20

For now, all he could do was give her anything he had. But if she asked, an=
d if he could, he would give her the world.=20

If anything bad happened to her, he could not help but think that it would =
be all his fault.

r. Most of them said crude things about her, but Astero paid them no mind. =
His only goal was to find her, and all his searching had not been futile. A=
 few days before his wedding, Astero had received information that she was =
living in a village in the north called Onen, quite a ways away from the no=

r giving him the life he had dreamed of.&nbsp;</p>
