"Why of course, I'd be delighted to have you!" exclaimed Jayda, the woman who allowed Rosella to stay with her.
"Lucky for you, I have an empty room!"



Rosella scowled as Jayda and Astero conversed about the living arrangements. She practically had to beg Jayda to
let her stay, and any money she made, she'd have to give two-thirds of it to Jayda. Fortunately, there was no
set price Jayda required of her, for Rosella often made very little money.



Astero simply had to ask, and Jayda was more than willing to let him stay for just five coins a month.



"Thank you so much, Lady Jayda," said Astero, bowing his head.



Jayda giggled and looked at Rosella. "Did you hear that? Lady Jayda!"



Rosella smiled bitterly.



Jayda cleared her throat. "Rosella, clean the spare room and then prepare dinner."



"Yes, ma'am," she replied.



After agreeing to introduce Astero to Jayda, he waited until the evening when she finished her shift, passing
the time by walking around the marketplace. He was willing to stay and keep her company, but she insisted he go
and do something with his day. Besides, Rosella didn't want him around when her employer was present.



When he came back to the stall at the end of the day, Rosella clearly saw that he had gone on a spending spree.
He brought bags of things he had bought from the market, likely clothes and other necessities, but he even
bought a pie from a baker's stall. She supposed it was expected since he had run away and carried nothing with
him, but how much did he have to afford all that?



Maybe she was just poor.



Rosella climbed the wooden staircase of Jayda's house to the second floor, Astero trailing behind her. There
were two rooms, one being Rosella's. The other room was empty and used for storage. Rosella would have to move
everything from there into the basement.



She opened the door and winced. There were more things she'd have to carry than she initially believed. Jayda's
home used to be an antique shop, and all the antiques were stored in this very room.



"You can stay in my room while I clean this up," said Rosella, tying her long dark brown hair back with string.
"This might take a while."



"Oh no, I'll do it," he said, placing all his bags by the door.



She shook her head. "I can't make a guest clean their own room."



"Aren't you also a guest?"



Rosella shrugged. "It doesn't matter."



"Of course it does," Astero insisted. "I'll do everything. Don't worry about it."



"Astero, it's fine, really," she assured him. "I'm happy to help!"



He shook his head vigorously. "I'm staying here, so it's my responsibility."



"You don't want my help?"



"I don't want to trouble you!"



Before Rosella could say anything, Astero reached down into one of his bags and took out the pie he had bought.
He held it in both bands carefully and handed it to her, his face donning a look of determination. "This is for
you."



Surprised, Rosella took the pie from his hands. "What's this for?" It was blackberry pie.



A memory itched at the back of her mind, but she couldn't quite recall what the significance of blackberry pie
was. Desserts were luxury foods, and she hadn't had them in a long time.



"I just thought you'd like it," he said, looking at her with sincerity. "Do you?"



"I... yes, but..." She couldn't wrap her head around it. Why would he do such a thing for her?



Rosella couldn't get any words out, and Astero had already reached into another bag to pull out a dress. It was
the pink and white dress she had admired in the marketplace, the one that reminded her of home. He held it up
for her to see.



"This is also for you," he said, face so serious she almost laughed.



Truthfully, Rosella was stunned. She stared at the dress, then glanced up at Astero. He looked determined to
give this to her, but he also looked nervous, as if afraid she wouldn't like it.



"I... I don't know what to say. You really didn't have to."



"I wanted to," he insisted. "Do you like it?"



"Of course I do," Rosella assured him. "It's just, I have no way to pay you back - "



He looked surprised. "I wasn't asking you to."



"But this must have been expensive - "



"It wasn't," he promised. "As long as you like it, I'm glad."



She laughed incredulously. "Really, Astero, this is too much. If this is for helping you find a place to stay, I
really wasn't expecting anything in return."



"I know you weren't. I just wanted to give them to you."



"Do you have anything else?" Rosella asked jokingly.



He placed the dress back into its bag, then went to reach in another bag. Her eyes nearly bulged out of her
head. "I didn't mean that!"



Astero had pulled out a glimmering pink gemstone necklace. It twinkled in the dim light, and Rosella's heart
stopped. It must have been worth at least fifty coins.



"I can't take this," said Rosella, shaking her head.



"If you don't like it, you can sell it," suggested Astero.



She sighed in frustration. Why was he giving all this to her? She hadn't done anything!



"Would you like anything else?" he asked.



"No!" Rosella nearly shouted. "No no no, this is enough, thank you."



He nodded, and Rosella was relieved he had no more gifts for her.



"Let me just put these in my room, and then I'll start cleaning," said Rosella. The pie looked so delicious she
wanted to eat it now, but she restrained herself.



Astero grabbed the two bags that carried her gifts, went to her room, and set them outside the closed door. "You
had a long day at work," he said, his voice soft. "I can do this myself."



She gazed at him, his dark eyes insistent. Why did she feel like he was hiding something?



However, Rosella just nodded and went into her room, taking the bags and shutting the door behind her.



Was he trying to court her? Rosella thought that'd be the most likely explanation, but he didn't seem like he
bought her all these things out of infatuation. He was new to this village and perhaps wanted a friend, but she
had a feeling that wasn't the case either. She couldn't figure out what he wanted from her.



Rosella set the pie down on her nightstand. Then, she grabbed the dress and held it in front of her, admiring
its beauty. How could he have known she'd wanted it? Had he been stalking her? But he didn't seem like he had
any ill intent. Rosella couldn't wrap her head around the situation.



The dress was beautiful, but she vowed not to wear it until she could pay him back, along with the necklace. It
would be a long while.



She hung up the dress in her wardrobe. It was the brightest thing she owned. It was certainly the brightest
thing in her dull room, consisting of a small wooden bed in the corner by the window, a single nightstand right
next to it, and a wardrobe on the opposite side. The room itself was terribly small, but Rosella didn't have
many things anyway. The storage room Astero would be staying in was actually bigger.



Astero. The bouquet of asters and roses came into her mind. She imagined a field of them under the rising sun.
