		The marketplace was as busy as ever. Rosella was finally allowed a break from her work, and she spent this time
		walking through the streets, glancing at what the merchants and vendors had to offer.



		After walking a few minutes, Rosella spotted a stall selling dresses. One particular dress caught her eye. It
		was mostly pink, with white outlines and flowery decorations. The sleeves were elbow-length and ended with lacy
		coverings. In the center of the neckline, there was a jeweled rose.



		She stared at the dress. Pink was the Ozario clan's traditional color. All her old dresses were pink, and she
		desperately wanted to buy it. The dresses she wore now were gray or tan. It was all she could really afford. And
		yet, this dress reminded her so much of home, she felt compelled to spend all her savings on it.



		"Rosella!" a voice shouted.



		Rosella startled, snapping out her trance. Her most recent employer stood before her, eyes angry.



		"It's been over ten minutes, you stupid girl!"



		"Oh, has it?" Rosella said, still a bit distracted, trying to get a better look at the dress.



		Then, she felt a stinging slap across her face.



		"Get back to the stall," ordered the woman. "No more breaks for you today."



		"Yes, ma'am," Rosella said immediately.



		"And I'm cutting your pay for today in half."



		That one hurt more. But all she said was, "Yes, ma'am."



		Rosella walked back to the flower stall, feeling defeated. She hadn't even realized that much time had gone by.
		Her mind was completely off the dress as she sat down at her booth, her thoughts now full of regret at the money
		she had just lost.



		It was a scorching summer day, and Rosella could barely breathe in the heat. However, she simply smiled at the
		passerby, urging people to purchase flowers from her employer's stand. She was only asked to fill in due to the
		woman's son being home sick. The promised pay had been good, until it was cut in half.



		Rosella sighed, resting her head on her hand propped up on the table. She closed her eyes, hoping to catch a few
		moments of rest.



		A sound in front of her made Rosella's eyes snap open. She stood up immediately and greeted, "Hello! Would you
		like to buy some flowers?"



		The man in front of her said nothing. He simply stared at her, as if he couldn't believe she was actually real.
		His eyes were dark, and they gazed at Rosella with such intensity it made her uncomfortable.



		However, she ignored this discomfort and cleared her throat. "What kind of flowers would you like, sir?"



		"Ah, I, um..." He stuttered. "I'm sorry, what did you say?"



		She smiled. Perhaps he was just nervous. "What kind of flowers would you like? Are they for a special lady?"



		He laughed awkwardly. "What would you recommend?"



		"Hmm." Rosella plucked a light pink rose from one of the bouquets. She held it out to him, and his eyes widened.
		"You can never go wrong with roses!"



		The man took the rose from her. He held it gently, as if in fear it would break. He stared at it, an
		unexplainable expression on his face.



		"Are roses your favorite?" he asked.



		Rosella nodded. "My name is Rosella, so I suppose I'm biased."



		"I see." He held the flower out to her. "For you, then."



		She took it back with a smile. "Why, thank you!"



		The man smiled at her, and she was struck by how much younger he looked when he smiled.



		"So... would you like a bouquet of roses, then?" Rosella suggested. "Or would you like some others mixed in?"



		He took a deep breath. "Actually, I was wondering if you knew of a place to stay around here? I'm new to the
		area."



		She thought for a moment. "There's an inn in the next town over. I've never stayed there. It's quite pricey from
		what I've heard."



		"How far from here is it?"



		"I'd say about a thirty minute walk."



		He grimaced. "Is there somewhere closer?"



		"I don't believe so. But if you have business here, I'm sure you could ask someone to stay with them."



		The man nodded. "Perhaps I'll do that then."



		She couldn't quite place it, but there was something about this man that seemed familiar. "I'm sorry, have we
		met before?"



		His eyes widened. "Ah, I don't believe so."



		"What's your name?" Rosella asked.



		He hesitated before saying, "Astero."



		"Astero? Why didn't you say so?" She turned and bent down to take a half a bouquet of asters from the bottom
		shelf. They were a beautiful lavender-violet. Rosella then took half a bouquet of pink roses. She mixed them
		together and tied their stems with a ribbon. After looking at her work and feeling satisfied, she turned back
		around and handed the bouquet to him. "A bouquet of asters and roses."



		The man, Astero, let out a shaky breath as he took it from her hands. "It's beautiful."



		Rosella smiled. He seemed genuinely fascinated. "You can give it to your special lady."



		His eyes met hers. He looked different from anyone she had seen before. His black hair was neatly combed, his
		face was free of exhaustion, and there was not a single speck of dirt on his clothes.



		"Where are you from?" Rosella couldn't contain her curiosity.



		"Ludha," he replied. "It's a small village north of here."



		"And what brings you to this place?"



		"I'm... looking for someone."



		"Oh? Is it the lady you want to give these flowers to?"



		He laughed. "Kind of."



		"Perhaps I know her!" Rosella was excited. She loved a good love story. "What's her name?"



		"Rosella."



		Rosella was taken aback. Then, she burst out laughing. She never imagined he would start flirting with her.
		"Impressive."



		Astero smiled shyly.



		"So who are you really looking for?"



		"Actually, I'm not looking for anyone. I'm here to hide."



		"From what?"



		"My family." He sighed, looking rather tired. "They arranged for me to marry the daughter of their friend. I
		didn't want to, so I left home."



		"An arranged marriage?" Rosella was incredulous. Back home in the sky, she had not been set up with anyone yet,
		but she knew that it would have come eventually had she not been banished.



		"Ridiculous, I know."



		"But you're a grown man! Surely they can't still do that? Unless you're some kind of royalty, what would be the
		point?"



		"It's a... cultural thing." Astero shrugged. "Anyway, that's why I'm here. What about you?"



		"What about me?"



		"What's your life like here? I'd like to know more about it if I'm to stay here."



		"It's been alright, I suppose. I haven't lived here for very long." She had moved to this village a few months
		ago, after she had been kicked out of the last town she lived in.



		"And you spend your time selling flowers?"



		Rosella laughed awkwardly. "This isn't my stall. I was just hired to work here for the day."



		"Where do you work then?"



		She looked at him pointedly. "Why are you asking so many questions?"



		He opened his mouth, then closed it immediately. His cheeks turned bright red from embarrassment.



		"Sorry," said Rosella, realizing that came out harsher than she intended. "I don't actually have a real job."



		Ever since she arrived on the ground fifteen years ago, Rosella had been unlucky in finding work. She traveled
		from town to town all over the place, and almost always something went wrong.



		When she looked back at Astero, he was looking at the ground, squeezing the bouquet of flowers so hard his hand
		turned pink. Why did he look as if he had been physically hurt?



		"Astero?" Rosella questioned.



		He glanced up at her, and when he did, he looked so upset Rosella was taken back. "I'm so sorry."



		She tilted her head quizzically. "For what?"



		"For... prying."



		"Oh, don't worry about it!" Rosella forced a laugh. "It could be worse!" It could be much worse.



		Astero didn't say a word.



		Rosella felt she should amend the situation. "Well, if you don't have a place to stay, I could ask the person
		I'm staying with to accommodate you as well."



		Immediately, his eyes lit up. "Yes, that would great, thank you."



		His eyes looked so familiar to her, but she couldn't figure out where she'd seen them before. The way they
		brightened when he was happy reminded her of someone. Perhaps they had met in a dream.
