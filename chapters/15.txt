As Kona walked through the town, where festivities were still in order for =
the wedding that was supposed to happen today, she almost felt bad at seein=
g all the happy people. No one outside of the main families of the five cla=
ns knew Astero Elessai was missing.=20

Kona had been the one to see him escape down the northern stairway. The way=
 he did it =E2=80=94 pricking the guards with a paralysis needle from the F=
en clan =E2=80=94 suggested he had done this before. It would cause no susp=
icion, as the guards would be standing there the entire time, and once the =
effects wore off, they wouldn't even know they had been paralyzed.=20

When she reported the news to Lord Ozario, it was the first time she had se=
en him laugh out loud. He said that Astero Elessai had actually done this b=
efore, sneaking into Ozario territory, paralyzing the guards, and climbing =
down the stairway. Lord Ozario never sent anyone to follow him, as he did n=
ot care much for what the Elessai heir was up to, and he would always be ba=
ck within the day. However, to climb down again the day before his wedding,=
 Lord Ozario wanted to see if Astero Elessai would be back before the day's=
 end, and alas, he was not. He was ecstatic to use this information to acqu=
ire the help of Josemi Elessai.=20

Today would be the day Kona set foot on the ground. Her task was to find As=
tero Elessai and keep track of him until the time came to bring him back to=
 the sky.=20

It was much too crowded in the town, and much too bright. Kona pulled her b=
lack hood over her head, trying to remain inconspicuous.=20

Children ran around the streets, chasing one another and laughing. She look=
ed up and saw an old, decrepit wooden building, where an old woman stood, s=
miling as she watched over the children.=20

This must have been an orphanage, and it actually looked far better than th=
e one Kona had grown up in, far to the west in Sanu clan territory. The San=
u clan had a reputation for spending a minuscule amount of their money on t=
he welfare of their people, despite having so much of it. Kona owed a debt =
to Lady Willow for rescuing her from that place and taking her to live in t=
he Ozario clan. The only reason she volunteered to be sent to the ground wa=
s to help Lady Willow and Lord Ozario get their revenge. She did not hate t=
he other clans as they did, and she did not do it for money. Kona simply wa=
nted to repay their kindness.=20

Suddenly, Kona heard a thud, followed by a yelp from a high-pitched voice. =
She turned and saw that a child had bumped into a rich-looking woman, who l=
ooked to be around the same age as Kona. The child had fallen to the ground=
 and was staring up at the woman in fear. She just glared at him.=20

"Watch it, brat," she snapped.=20

The nanny of the orphanage quickly hobbled over. She did not help the child=
 up, and instead, bowed her head to the woman. "My lady, my most sincere ap=
ologies."=20

The woman scoffed. "It will take more than that."=20

"Of course, anything you'd like!" The old nanny's voice was shaky, and Kona=
 saw her hands trembling.=20

"This child must be punished," declared the woman. "That seems fair, doesn'=
t it?"=20

The two maidservants by her side quickly nodded along, agreeing with her.=
=20

The little boy on the ground instantly burst into tears, his entire body sh=
aking from the racking sobs. However, the woman showed no compassion.=20

"What do you think your punishment should be, hm?" she asked mockingly.=20

Kona felt her blood boil, and she clenched her fists in rage. She needed to=
 remain inconspicuous, but this woman was too cruel for Kona to just sit ba=
ck and watch. Kona had been just like him, an orphan pushed around by peopl=
e with power.=20

Steeling herself, Kona walked over there with her head held high. She was s=
tronger now. She did not fear people like her. Not anymore.=20

Kona crouched down and held the boy in her arms. "Are you all right?" she a=
sked.=20

He gazed at her with teary eyes, lips trembling.=20

"Excuse me," interjected the woman, sounding annoyed. "Who are you?"=20

Kona looked up at her. The woman was beautiful, with long brown hair and st=
ormy gray eyes. The sharp angles of her face gave her an intimidating aura.=
 The dark blue dress she wore looked expensive and intricately crafted, giv=
ing Kona the impression that this woman was powerful indeed.=20

She stood up and faced her. Kona was shorter, and she cursed her unfortunat=
e genes. "Kona," she answered. "And you?"=20

The woman raised her eyebrows in surprise. "You don't know me?"=20

"Apologies, I'm not from here. I came for the wedding."=20

Strangely enough, at the mention of the wedding, the woman's expression cra=
cked every so slightly. "Ah," she said, laughing awkwardly, "of course. The=
 wedding."=20

"...yes, the wedding."=20

The woman composed herself and regained her ice-cold expression. "It doesn'=
t matter. Out of the way. The boy must be punished."=20

"For what, exactly?"

"Injuring me."=20

Kona scanned the clearly unhurt woman. "Injured where?"

"Does it matter?" she snapped. "The point is, he almost did. Isn't that eno=
ugh?"=20

Kona was flabbergasted. "Are you serious?"=20

"Why wouldn't I be?" replied the woman, equally taken aback. "If I actually=
 had gotten hurt, he would be sent to the ground."=20

"It was an accident. Are you always this heartless?"=20

A flash of rage appeared on the woman's face, and Kona thought for a moment=
, she would have to physically defend herself. However, the old nanny inter=
cepted. "My lady, please have mercy," she begged, putting her hands togethe=
r to show sincerity. "The boy will be disciplined, I assure you."

The woman thought for a moment before saying, "Very well then. Since today =
is a special day, I will show mercy just this once."=20

"Thank you," cried the old nanny. "I wish you everlasting happiness in your=
 marriage, my lady."=20

The woman smiled tersely and did not reply.=20

The old nanny bent down and ushered the boy to his feet, and the two of the=
m hurried inside the orphanage before any more harm could be done, leaving =
Kona with the woman who she now realized was Melody Dorina.=20

"Well?" She made a 'shoo' gesture with her hand. "Scram."=20

Kona scowled, but she did step out of Melody Dorina's way. As she and her m=
aidservants walked past, Kona couldn't resist muttering, "I see why the gro=
om ran away."=20

Melody Dorina whirled around so fast, Kona nearly got dizzy herself. "Excus=
e me?"=20

Kona knew she shouldn't have drawn attention to herself, but the fearful ey=
es of the little boy =E2=80=94 eyes that reminded her so much of herself =
=E2=80=94 kept haunting her mind.=20

"You heard me," she replied, making herself appear fearless and unmovable.=
=20

Melody Dorina's eyes narrowed. "Are you trying to prove something? Because =
this is pointless."=20

It most likely was. What was Kona trying to accomplish by angering Young La=
dy Dorina? She undoubtedly did not regret scaring the poor boy, and Kona kn=
ew nothing she said would change her attitude. Dejected, Kona bowed her hea=
d and did not say a word.=20

However, Melody Dorina slowly walked closer to her with a scrutinizing gaze=
. She hissed, "How did you know?"=20

Her striking gray eyes caught Kona off guard, and she almost didn't hear wh=
at Melody Dorina said. "Know what?"=20

"That Astero is gone!"=20

Right. No one outside the main families of the clans were supposed to know.=
 Kona scolded herself for being careless, and she replied, "There are rumor=
s, that's all."=20

Melody Dorina glared. "People have been talking behind my back?"=20

"You cannot stop the people from gossiping, Young Lady Dorina."=20

Kona heard her take in a huge breath, as if she were trying to calm herself=
 down. Her hands were clenched into fists at her sides. "Let me tell you so=
mething," she said, her voice quiet and deadly. "Astero was kidnapped by th=
e south. If I hear someone say he ran away, I will have them punished. Unde=
rstood?"=20

"But what if that's the truth?"

"It's not!" she cried, baring pearly white teeth against red lips. "He woul=
dn't do that!"=20

"If you say so," replied Kona, shrugging.=20

Melody Dorina gazed at her suspiciously. "What was your name again?"=20

"Kona."=20

"What clan are you from?"

"Ozario."=20

"I will speak with your leader. I want you punished immediately."=20

"What for?"=20

"Suggesting that my own husband ran away from me!"=20

"He's not your husband." Kona smiled slightly, making her own expression on=
e of pity. "I don't think he wants to be."=20

"How dare you!" she shrieked, stepping closer to Kona, so close she could f=
eel Melody Dorina's breath on her cheeks. "Who are you to assume what Aster=
o wants?"=20

Kona, feeling satisfied that she managed to get under the other girl's skin=
, said, "I just know that if I were engaged to you, I'd rather go to the gr=
ound."=20

"That can be arranged," said Melody Dorina through gritted teeth.=20

"Oh, there you are!" exclaimed a cheerful voice.=20

Both Kona and Melody Dorina turned to see Lady Willow sauntering up to them=
, smiling brightly. Her sundress was bright pink, with clear jewels that tw=
inkled in the sunlight. She looked amused.=20

Lady Willow stood beside Kona and bowed her head in acknowledgement to Melo=
dy Dorina. "Young Lady Dorina, a pleasure."=20

Melody Dorina looked annoyed. "I'm sorry, who are you?"=20

"Kona's guardian," she replied easily. "I apologize for any issues she has =
caused."=20

"She insulted me!"=20

"She is young," said Lady Willow, smiling insincerely. "I trust you will no=
t let such insults get to you, as merciful and mature as you are."=20

Melody Dorina's face turned red, either with embarrassment or anger, Kona d=
idn't know.=20

"I'm afraid we must take our leave." Lady Willow took a hold of Kona's wris=
t and quickly left Melody Dorina standing there with her two maidservants, =
looking stunned.=20

"I'm barely younger than her," muttered Kona.=20

"And equally immature," replied Lady Willow, rolling her eyes. "You're the =
last one we're waiting on, you know."=20

"I'm sorry, Lady Willow." Kona didn't mean to cause her trouble.=20

Lady Willow sighed. "What's done is done." She glanced at Kona with worry. =
"I just hope you're ready."=20

Kona nodded with determination. "I won't fail you, nor Lord Ozario."=20

"Be careful." Lady Willow stopped walking and took Kona into her arms, embr=
acing her tightly. "I don't want to lose another little sister."=20

All Kona knew of Rosella Ozario was that she was cruelly sent to the ground=
 fifteen years ago. She did not know why, as Lord Ozario and Lady Willow ne=
ver spoke of it around her. Kona hugged her back, almost tearing up at the =
fact that Lady Willow was now shorter than her.=20

"I will be careful," Kona replied. She would do everything in her power to =
find Astero Elessai. And she would do everything in her power to bring down=
 the other clans. Lady Willow thought of her as a little sister, but to Kon=
a, she was more like a mother. And she would protect her mother no matter w=
hat.=20

"Good." Lady Willow pulled away, eyes shining with tears. "Let us meet with=
 the others."
