		"This will be your room," said the woman who was now his mother, opening a pair of double doors into what was
		the biggest room the boy had ever seen. Granted, their house was also the biggest house he had ever seen. There
		were large white columns at the entrance, and many windows spanned the long width of the manor. As he walked
		through the halls, there were statues that his mother explained were the gods worshipped by the Elessai clan.
		Purple banners lined the walls, the signature color of their clan. He would be wearing that color from now on.



		The room he would be staying in had a bed much too big for him, with purple sheets and fluffy pillows. A
		painting of a golden arch spanned the wall at the head of the bed, displaying a summer scenery of clear blue
		skies and looming palm trees. Tiny people were drawn at the foot of the arch, marveling at its beauty. The boy
		took a wider look around the room and saw glass doors leading to a balcony overlooking the back of the manor,
		where where in the distance beyond a long flight of stairs, people milled about in the marketplace. And just
		beyond that, he could see a crystal blue sea.



		"Do you like it, Astero?" his mother asked.



		He nodded. It was strange finally being called a name, but he liked the sound of it.



		"I will have clothes brought for you." His mother placed a hand on his shoulder and he gazed in wonder around
		the room. "You may bathe in there," she said, pointing to a door right across the bed. "I'll have the servants
		assist you."



		His mother left, and Astero waited until the servants arrived, ushering him into the washroom. It was made
		entirely of exquisite white marble, with an enormous square bathtub. Flowers stood on pedestals, filling the
		room with a sweet aroma. There were roses of all colors, and Astero felt a tug at his heart. He wondered where
		his Anle was.



		The servants filled the bath with water, and steam filled the air. He marveled at the view. The only water he
		used to bathe in was from the ice cold well in Ludha.



		Astero took off his clothes and stepped carefully into the water. It was warm, and he smiled in delight as he
		immersed his whole body in it.



		He leaned against the side as a servant washed his hair, closing his eyes as his scalp was massaged. Being taken
		care of like this was a foreign concept to him. First, his Anle had saved his life, and now, he would be living
		in the biggest house he had ever seen, with servants catering to his needs and a mother who loved him.



		He would tell his mother tomorrow that he was from the ground. Astero was sure she would accept him anyway, just
		like his Anle.



		Astero finished bathing, and the servants helped him get dressed into brown pants and dark purple robes that
		nearly touched the floor. He had never worn clothes this nice before. They gently brushed his hair which had
		been cut short just earlier that day.



		As soon as he left the bathroom, Astero ran over to the balcony. There were more people in this part of the town
		than in his entire village, and people looked much happier here. Just beyond the town's edge was a glittering
		sea, and he desperately wanted to take a dive in it.



		He stayed outside for the longest time, watching the sun set below the horizon, illuminating the town in
		breathtaking orange light. It would be nicer if he could see it with Anle. Perhaps she was watching the sunset
		too.



		Tomorrow, he would ask his mother if he could see her. He knew her name was Rosella, and although she did not
		give him a last name, he believed people would know her. She seemed like a highborn lady, with all the poise and
		grace of a noble woman. She looked like a princess in his eyes.



		When darkness set in, Astero fell asleep in the bed much too large for him. He had never experienced such
		comfort before, having slept on floors or outdoors most of his life. There was so much luxury in the sky, where
		grand manors and flower fields existed directly under the sun. Not for one moment did he ever regret climbing
		the stairway.



		The next day, the servants woke him up to escort him to breakfast in the dining pavilion outside, where his
		mother sat waiting for him.



		"Good morning, Astero," she greeted as he sat down across from her.



		"Good morning, mother," he said, sitting down next to her.



		She smiled. "Here, eat," said his mother, shoveling food onto his plate.



		His eyes widened. "All this?"



		"All this," she confirmed with a nod.



		The food was exquisite, served in delicate presentations. Food he had never seen before covered the entire
		table. Astero was used to scraps and leftovers and digging through other people's thrown-out remains. He finally
		realized this was what he'd have every day, living as a sky person.



		So he ate plate after plate until he felt the need to throw up. His mother continued to fill his plate whenever
		he wanted, not caring how impolite his style of eating was. She looked happy just seeing him enjoy himself.



		After reaching a point where his stomach began to build up, Astero begrudgingly pushed his most recent plate
		away from him. "I'm full."



		His mother laughed, and he looked up at this woman he had met yesterday. She wore a golden band around her head,
		giving her the appearance of an angel. Her long purple robes matched the color of Astero's own. They were family
		now, he realized, and she didn't seem like she would make him do chores or make him steal from others in the
		marketplace. He didn't even need to wash his own hair or find his own food. Was it going to be like this
		forever?



		"Lady Elessai," said a servant approaching the table. He bowed his head low before speaking, and Astero wondered
		if they would do that for him too. "Lord Elessai has just arrived."



		She nodded in acknowledgment, although she seemed more tense.



		Just a moment later, a man marched into the pavilion. His stern face and flowing purple robes made him seem
		extremely intimidating, and Astero unconsciously sunk back into his chair.



		His mother looked up at the man. "How did it go?" she asked.



		He sighed, seating himself across from her. "The Ozario girl was sent to the ground."



		Astero looked at his mother who suddenly looked very sad. "Was there no other way?"



		"I'm afraid not," he replied sternly, filling up his plate with food. Then, his eyes turned to Astero. "Who's
		this?"



		"His name is Astero," said his mother, a determined expression on her face. "I am adopting him as my son."



		"Was he sent from the Fen clan?"



		She shook her head. "I met him at an orphanage in the town. He seemed to have strayed here from the east."



		Astero was confused as to why she was lying, but he said nothing.



		The man's gaze fixated on Astero, scrutinizing. Astero wondered if the man was going to yell at him or kick him
		out of his home. However, his expression didn't seem loathing or malicious like the other people who brought
		Astero into their homes. Truthfully, Astero couldn't tell what this man was thinking at all.



		"Astero, was it?" he said.



		The boy nodded.



		"How old are you?" he asked, his deep voice resonating within the pavilion.



		"Eight," he replied quietly.



		The man sighed. "Well, if Josemi wants you to stay, I must let you."



		"Kairo," she said sternly, glaring at him.



		He gave a small smile, and Astero instantly relaxed. "It will be nice to have a son," he said warmly, and
		Astero's mother gave a firm nod.



		"Will you be my father?" Astero asked.



		"I will," he said, standing up to ruffle Astero's hair. "And you will be the clan heir. From now on, your name
		is Astero Elessai."



		"Elessai," he repeated, testing the name. He had never had a name, and now he had two.



		His mother smiled, engulfing him in a hug. She felt so comforting, like a blanket he could embrace and instantly
		feel safe. For the first time in his life, he had a mother who cared for him like this, who wanted him to stay.
		And now, he even had a father who would make him the clan heir.



		And yet, there was something bothering him. "Who was sent to the ground?" Astero asked.



		His father looked surprised he even asked, but he answered. "Rosella, the youngest daughter from the Ozario
		clan. She had helped a child from the ground into the sky, and so she was punished for it."



		"You all voted to banish her?" His mother sighed. "The poor girl."



		"People from the ground are criminals and savages." His words sent daggers into Astero's heart.



		"I know," agreed his mother, and the boy nearly forgot how to breathe. "But she's just a child. The one from the
		ground should be punished, not her."



		"Children should know better. We couldn't find the one from the ground, so she had to be punished instead."



		They were talking about him, he realized, panic flooding into his mind. His Anle had been sent to the ground
		because of him. Because they couldn't find him.



		Astero's whole body was shaking, and his mother looked at him with concern. "Are you cold?"



		He nodded absentmindedly.



		"It is much colder in the north," said his father. "Come, let's go inside." He held out a hand for Astero to
		take.



		Astero stared at it and faced a dilemma. If he took his father's hand, he would go into his new house and live
		his new life. He would be a clan heir, whatever that meant. He would be Astero Elessai. But in doing so, he'd
		leave behind his Anle. The girl who protected him and cared for him and showed him the stars. The girl who gave
		him her shoes when his feet bled, who promised to make him blackberry pie. She was on the ground, all alone. And
		he was in the sky, surrounded by a new family.



		She risked her life for him, and she went against everything her people believed in for him.



		If he just told them who he was, he would be punished instead. Maybe they would spare her then, and let her come
		back to her life in the sky. All Astero had to do was tell them.



		But he didn't. Instead, he took his father's hand and headed inside his new home.
