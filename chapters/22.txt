The sun was setting, and Rosella still hadn't returned. Astero had spent mo=
st of the day in his bed, lying helpless and tired. Rosella had left enough=
 food and drinks by his bedside, so he rarely had to get up, but he managed=
 to find the strength to go downstairs and clean his empty plates and cups.=
 He also cleaned the house a bit once he realized Rosella was running late,=
 wanting to take at least one job off her hands while she was out.=20

However, the sky grew darker, and Astero began to grow uneasy. He tried to =
convince himself that Rosella had been on plenty of jobs without him, and t=
here was no reason for him to worry. And yet, as day turned to night, Aster=
o couldn't help but feel worried.=20

When he heard the front door open, Astero stood quickly from his seat at th=
e dining table, relief immediately washing over him. "Rosella!" he exclaime=
d.=20

That relief quickly turned to dread when he saw that it was not Rosella who=
 walked through the door.=20

"Just me!" Jayda smiled as she closed the door behind her. "Is she not back=
 yet?"=20

Astero's heartbeat thudded in his ears. "No, she's not." His voice sounded =
miles away.=20

He did not know what sort of expression he wore on his face, but it was eno=
ugh for Jayda to hurry over to him and pat his shoulder comfortingly. "I'm =
sure she's fine. Perhaps she was too lazy to cook dinner, so she's out buyi=
ng food somewhere," Jayda said lightly.=20

"She said this job wouldn't take too long."=20

"Things change on the job." Jayda hung up her shawl and took a seat at the =
table. "As long as she's making enough money to pay me, that's all I care a=
bout."=20

Astero had lost count at how many times he wanted to throw something at her=
.=20

"I'm sure she'll be back any minute," assured Jayda. "I'm starving! Aren't =
you?" she asked with a sickeningly sweet smile.=20

He had had enough. "I'm going to look for her." Astero strode towards the d=
oor and nearly broke the handle with how forcefully he opened it.=20

"Young Master!" He heard Jayda call after him, but Astero did not stop. He =
ran towards the direction of the banquet hall, ignoring how tired and dizzy=
 he felt from his sickness.=20

The sky grew darker and darker, and few people were still outside. Astero r=
an all the way to the banquet hall, and all the while, his head spun, and h=
is legs nearly gave out. When he finally reached the building, Astero pushe=
d open the doors and ran up to the first person he saw.=20

"Where are the servants from the banquet?" he demanded.=20

The person's eyes widened. "Ah =E2=80=94 the banquet ended hours ago. Every=
one went home."=20

"Is Rosella still here?" he asked hurriedly.=20

The person in front of him blinked. "Who?"=20

Trying not to take out his frustrations on this stranger, Astero turned aro=
und and exited the building, running back the way he came.=20

Where could she have gone?=20

As he ran, rain began to fall. Astero's vision grew blurry, and he stumbled=
 to the side of the pathway, leaning against a house. Panting, Astero sat d=
own on the ground, trying to slow his breathing. This wasn't the time to pa=
nic. He couldn't afford to focus on his condition right now. Rosella was mi=
ssing, and perhaps he was simply overreacting, and Jayda was right about he=
r buying food for dinner, and she could have been back at the house already=
, waiting at the dinner table for him to return...=20

But on the off chance that she wasn't, he could not stop now.=20

Then, far in the distance, Astero saw the white fence that surrounded the n=
earby meadow that led to the forest. A strange shadow lay against it, and A=
stero normally wouldn't have bothered to see what it was, but something abo=
ut it looked familiar. As we walked closer and closer, he could barely make=
 out a human shape slumped against the fence. He stepped closer.=20

When Astero had lived on the ground, a man he stayed with snapped his arm a=
fter Astero tried to steal some of his food. The pain had been excruciating=
, and he remembered it so clearly because since then, he had never felt any=
 pain like it.=20

But somehow, seeing Rosella at this very moment, that painful feeling from =
long ago did not even come close.=20

He lurched forward onto the ground in front of her, clutching her cold hand=
s. "Rosella," he whispered.=20

Her eyes remained closed. He pushed aside the strands of hair that covered =
her face. He placed his shaking hands on the sides of her face, hoping that=
 she would open her eyes. The mere though of never seeing their amber glow =
in the morning sunlight shattered his heart, and he was grateful for the ra=
in that overshadowed his own tears.=20

"Rosella, please," he begged, resting his forehead against hers. He shut hi=
s eyes, wishing this was only a nightmare. "Please, please, please."=20

How pathetic he was, having failed her twice.=20

He didn't know any doctors in the village. He didn't know where to get help=
. He was worthless.=20

"Astero?"=20

His eyes snapped open, and he saw that Rosella had opened her eyes. They lo=
oked tired and drained, but they were open.=20

Overcome with relief, Astero wrapped her up in his arms, sobbing into her s=
houlder.=20

"I'm sorry," she said quietly into his ear. "I left the hat you gave me."=
=20

He choked out a laugh. "I'll buy you a new one."=20

"Don't waste your money." She sounded like she was smiling.=20

"It's not a waste if it's for you."=20

"Don't flirt with me."=20

"I'm serious."=20

"Also, I'm afraid I cannot hug you back. I can barely feel my arms."=20

Astero immediately reeled back. "What happened?"=20

She sighed. "I will tell you, I promise. Can we go home first?"=20

He nodded. "Of course." However, Astero did not want her walking in the rai=
n in her condition. Ignoring every ache in his body, Astero swooped one arm=
 under her knees, and he gripped her waist with his other arm. He easily li=
fted her into the air, and he walked them both back to Jayda's house.=20

Normally, she would have argued. However, Rosella seemed much too tired to =
do anything. She rested her head against his chest and smiled. "Thank you."=
=20

Astero hoped she couldn't feel his embarrassingly rapid heartbeat. "It's th=
e least I can do."=20

She shook her head. "Thank you for finding me."=20

I would have torn this whole village apart just to find you.

"You're so kind," she continued.=20

Only to you.

"You never ask for anything in return."=20

I would never ask anything of you.

"Will you stay with me?" she asked. "Just for a bit longer? Before you go b=
ack home?"=20

My home is your home. I took it from you.

"I will," he said, feeling the heavy weight of guilt.=20

He had failed her again.
