		She had only been attending jobs with Astero for a few days, but leaving for a job on her own for the first time
		without him made Rosella more uneasy than she cared to admit. She had grown used to him being by her side.
		Rosella never had many friends on the ground, and if she did, the friendship did not last long. A part of her,
		the dark and hopeless part of her, anticipated the day he would leave. He had a home, a family, a fiancée, and
		money. He had no reason to stay by her side.



		And yet, she desperately wanted him to. Rosella couldn't remember the last time she felt so happy.



		The walk to the banquet hall wasn't long, but the heat did start to get to her. Because it was a formal event,
		Rosella had to wear a dress that covered her arms and went down to her ankles, and sweat began to build on her
		skin. She made sure to wear the hat Astero had bought her, which gave her some degree of comfort in his absence.



		Rosella greeted people she knew as she walked past, which wasn't many. However, she was quite well-known in the
		village for being willing to take up any job, no matter what it may be. She was also known for being easy to
		push around, which was true. Rosella valued money, and she would do whatever it took to acquire it, no matter
		how little the amount, and no matter the cost to her pride. She learned to throw away useless things like pride
		a long time ago. If her family saw her now, what would they think of her?



		It had been fifteen years since she had last seen her parents, sixteen years since she had last seen her
		brother, and probably over twenty years since she had last seen her sister. If she ran into her siblings now,
		Rosella likely would not be able to recognize them. She could remember her parents fairly well, but Soro
		Crisanto's face would likely have changed. And it had been too long since Anle Willow's face crossed her memory.
		But she remembered their smiles and their warmth, which kept her company throughout the years. She imagined them
		living happily in the Ozario manor, her father still clan leader, Soro Crisanto as the heir, and his wife at his
		side. Anle Willow would probably still be traveling, but Rosella liked to imagine her returning home every few
		months. It gave her comfort thinking they were happy without her. She didn't want to be the reason for any
		unhappiness in their family.



		It was all right that she be the only one suffering, as long as they were happy.



		"Rosella!" a man, who she recognized as one of her previous employers, called out to her. "Going to a job?"



		She smiled and nodded. "The renovations meeting!"



		"Next week, I need you to watch my daughter for a day!"



		"How much will you pay me?"



		"Does it matter?"



		Rosella laughed sadly. "I suppose not." She proceeded to walk a bit faster to reach her destination.



		The banquet hall was quite close to Mr. Hestyn's house. It was the largest building in the village, and Rosella
		has been there many times before to clean. She hadn't served in a formal event in a long time, and thinking
		about making a fool of herself in front of respected town leaders made her body tingle with nerves. Rosella
		wished she had Astero's arm to hold on to.



		Steeling herself, Rosella headed inside the building. The entire banquet hall covered the first floor, and two
		marble staircases led up to the second floor, where the private rooms and washrooms were located. People milled
		about, setting up tables and chairs for the meeting. It was an extremely important event for Onen, a village
		that hadn't seen proper renovations in a long time.



		"Workers, to the kitchens!" called a voice, and Rosella hurried along with the others. "The town leaders will be
		here in five minutes!"



		Once inside the kitchen, Rosella put on a white apron over her gray dress, took as many plates as she could
		carry, and scuttled into the banquet hall along with the rest of the workers, placing the plates of freshly
		cooked food at a seat at each table. Her years of work and serving gave her plenty of experience with balancing
		multiple plates along her arms, and she noticed the stares of horror and fascination from the others.



		"As expected," praised one of the women passing by her.



		Rosella smiled in response. She prided herself on the quality and efficiency of her work, and it often earned
		her bonus pay, which was the real goal. She noticed the people in charge eyeing her with amazement, and that
		gave her encouragement.



		After all the tables were set, the multitude of workers took their places at the sides of the room, and the
		leaders from the town made their entrance.



		Most of them were men in fancy tunics, and some even wore cravats just to show that they could. The clothing was
		nothing compared to the wardrobe worn by clan members up in the sky, but they were some of the nicest she had
		seen on the ground thus far.



		The men strode into the room, and the air immediately grew quiet, allowing more room for the size of their
		presence. This village saw them as saviors who would finally build better houses, import quality food, and
		provide more money for entertainment.



		Rosella didn't particularly care. Her mind was focused on becoming the best server, hopefully obtaining a bonus
		reward, and hopefully seeking more job opportunities, perhaps from one of these rich men.



		They all took their seats at the various tables and conversed with one another while eating. Rosella took deep,
		steady breaths, trying not to pass out from the heat, and she noticed a lot of the other servants wiping sweat
		off their foreheads or swaying on their feet. She could not afford to pass out. The payment for this job was
		worth more than her life.



		Although, she said that about every job.



		Suddenly, her eyes locked on to a water glass belonging to one of the men that was nearing empty. Before any of
		the other servants could take action, Rosella immediately headed to the refreshments table, picked up one of the
		jugs of water, and glided over to that table.



		She approached the man from behind. "More water, sir?" Rosella asked, plastering a smile on her face.



		He turned around in his chair to look at her, and his previously neutral face turned wide-eyed with shock.
		"You," he breathed.



		Rosella was taken aback. "I'm — I'm sorry?"



		He continued to stare at her.



		She racked her brain for where and when she could have possibly met this man before. He didn't look at all
		familiar to her. He looked twice her age, and he was clearly rich. They obviously didn't run in the same
		circles. Perhaps he had mistaken her for someone else.



		Deciding to ignore the awkward turn of events, Rosella reached around him and filled up his water glass. All his
		staring made her uncomfortable, and she wanted to leave as soon as possible.



		"Mine too, miss," said another man at the table, and Rosella immediately hurried over to him. However, she could
		feel the man's eyes tracking her every move, and despite the heat, it made her blood run cold.



		Rosella quickly returned to the refreshments table and set the water jug down. Then, she took her place by the
		wall once again, ignoring the intense pounding of her heart. The way the man looked at her made her more nervous
		than she cared to admit.



		Where could they have possibly met? Rosella's memory truly wasn't the best, and she had met many people over the
		years. Most faces made no impression on her. But apparently, she was important enough for him to remember.



		She couldn't get the nervous feeling out of her head, and for the rest of the banquet meeting, Rosella did not
		refresh anyone else's beverage or pick up any empty plates. She stayed by the wall as the time passed by, having
		given up on getting any sort of bonus money. All Rosella wanted was to leave as soon as possible.



		When the meeting finally ended after an hour, Rosella quickly headed into the kitchen to remove her apron. Then,
		she went upstairs to the washroom, splashing water on her face. She needed to calm down. Rosella closed her eyes
		and took deep breaths. Her skin was heating up, and she felt sick. Rosella nearly laughed at the image of her
		and Astero lying sick on the floor of his bedroom while Jayda complained about having to cook dinner herself.



		However, when another person entered the washroom, Rosella felt nothing but horror.



		It was him.



		"It is you, isn't it." His voice seemed almost giddy, and a horrifying smile spread across his face.



		Rosella was rooted in place. She felt paralyzed.



		"What was your name again?" he asked, stepping closer.



		She shook her head frantically. "I don't think we've met before."



		His expression immediately darkened. "You don't remember me?"



		"You must be mistaken — "



		"After all the money I gave you?" His dark blue eyes turned murderous. "After everything we did together?"



		Her breaths came out quicker, and she squeezed her hands together to stop them from trembling. "I'm sorry," she
		whispered, looking down at his feet. His face terrified her. "I don't remember you."



		He stepped closer, close enough that his chest was nearly pressed up against her face, and suddenly, a memory
		came to her mind. A room. A bed. Hands on her wrists. Her face obscured by a man's chest, so close she could
		barely breathe.



		She did know him. Just a few years ago, Rosella had sold her body to a man willing to pay her large sums every
		night she spent with him. She had done it before and hardly ran into problems. Most of the men were lonely, in
		need of companionship, and she gave it to them in exchange for money. Some were rough with her, but they had
		never gone too far. However, there was one man who refused to listen to her. No matter how much she said she
		didn't like something, he would never stop. Rosella let this happen, for she believed the money was worth it.



		Until the night he snapped her wrist and still didn't stop, no matter how much she cried.



		Rosella left that town with the most money she had ever made, as well as a broken wrist. And since then, she
		refused to do that kind of work again.



		The man in front of her forcibly grabbed her chin and tilted her head up so she couldn't look away. He peered
		down at her, eyes blazing. "Then I will make you remember."



		Rosella took a step back, but he simply took a step forward.



		"You left me," he accused angrily. "I had money to give, and you left anyway!"



		She swallowed hard. Rosella glanced at the doorway, and the most obvious solution finally came to mind. "Help!"
		she cried. "Help! Help — !"



		The man covered her mouth and backed her all the way up against the wall. "Quiet," he hissed. "You'll regret
		that."



		Think, Rosella. Think.



		She tried to calm down by looking around. Wash buckets. Water tubs. Drown him? She wasn't strong enough to hold
		him down. Perhaps she could splash water in his face, but that would hardly even startle him.



		Think, Rosella.



		Her eyes fixed upon the windowsill. A ceramic vase was placed there, holding white orchids and lilies. The sun
		shown down on them, illuminating their beauty.



		Rosella turned back to the man. As swiftly as possible, Rosella brought up her knee right between his legs.



		The man cried out and let her go, falling to the ground like a broken doll.



		Rosella grabbed the vase and, in one fell swoop, smashed it against his head.



		He slumped over, unconscious.



		Rosella stepped back with trembling hands. Not a single thought ran through her head.



		She tried running for the door, but she tripped over his lifeless body, crashing to the ground next to him. Her
		own arms braced the fall, but she fell right on top of the vase shards. Covered in cuts with sleeves soaked in
		blood, Rosella picked herself back up and stumbled out the door.



		Standing just outside were two people. They startled as Rosella opened the door, but she didn't have time to
		think about them, or what the scene looked like to bystanders. All she needed to do was leave.



		Rosella descended the stairs and flew out the main entrance. Not even noticing the heat, Rosella ran and ran
		through the village, hugging her bleeding arms close to her chest.



		A wave of tiredness hit her so suddenly she nearly collapsed in the middle of the path. Rosella cut through the
		middle of two houses and hobbled over to the white wooden fence that cut off the village from the meadow and
		forest. It provided some protection from the sun, and she leaned against it, her legs giving out until she was
		sitting on the ground. Rosella closed her eyes, and before the darkness took her, she remembered that she had
		left the hat Astero gave her back at the banquet hall.
