<p class="w3-display-middle">
Long ago, pieces of the earth rose into the sky, creating a world in the clouds. A place where only gods were
said to live, it was natural that only the worthy were allowed to enter such a place. The leaders of earth could
enter first, along with their closest companions and followers. For years and years, the population in the sky
remained small.



However, those on the ground grew discontent. They believed land was land, whether it be on the ground or in the
sky. No one had a claim to the world above, so it should be the right of any person to choose where to live.



Eventually, anyone who wished to live in the sky could do so. Larger stairways were built as paths to and from
the sky, and many people gathered their families and belongings, making their way to the new world. Of course,
why would anyone still choose to live on the ground? The population in the sky increased exponentially, and
soon, the majority of the world now lived in the sky.



As time went on, the people of the sky grew resentful towards the place they once lived. They saw the ground as
hell, and there was no room for evil in their new world. It was decided that those who committed evil acts would
be banished to the ground, living their days in a hellish land.



Centuries went by, and this same process continued. However, there were people born on the ground who had
committed no crimes, and were simply there due to the mistakes of their ancestors.



One of these people was a young boy, an orphan whose parents died soon after his birth. This boy did not have a
name for himself, nor a true home. He lived on the streets, and occasionally, strangers would let him stay in
their home. Some had good intentions, some did not. None of them let him stay for long.



The boy spent most of his time outside, and because of this, he had a constant view of the sky. The land up
there looked so peaceful and beautiful. He imagined that during the daytime, he'd be surrounded by the clouds,
the blue sky everywhere around him with the sun enveloping his body in warmth. During the nighttime, he'd have a
clear view of the stars. It was a world he could only dream of.



He knew dreaming was fruitless. Yet, he couldn't help but wonder how much better his life would have been if he
had been born up there.



As he gazed upon the sky, a woman stopped in front of him. She took in his ragged appearance with a disgusted
look on her face, but as if she didn't have a choice, the woman grabbed his wrist and pulled him along to her
home. Inside, there was a man and two children younger than the boy himself. They all turned to him with curious
eyes as he and the woman entered.



"All right, I brought him," she announced, looking at the man. "Are you sure about this?"



He nodded, his gaze focusing on the boy. "It is true that you have no family, correct?"



The boy did not reply.



"We need you to do something," the man explained. He grabbed the boy's hand and took him to sit down in an empty
chair. "We need you to go to the stairway connecting the ground to the sky and find the exact times the guards
aren't there."



"Why?" he asked, more intrigued than scared.



"I am trying to get my family there." The man looked at the woman, but all she did was roll her eyes unkindly.
"I was from the sky, but I was banished here. I need to know how to get back up."



"This wouldn't even need to happen if you didn't gamble away all our savings!" snapped the woman.



The man's face morphed into one of complete anger. "Well it's too late now!" he shouted back at her. "We can
either stay here and starve to death, or go to the sky, find my family, and live a better life. I'm trying to
save us."



"You're the one that's killing us!" she cried.



He slapped her in the face, so hard she was knocked to the ground. "If you want me to kill you, I will!"



The two children who were sitting at the dinner table were silent, although one had silent tears streaming down
her face. The other had his eyes closed, as if trying to imagine that none of this was real.



The man turned to the boy again, his face less gentle than before. He looked almost desperate as he said, "You
must do this for us. If you went missing or were killed, no one would even know. You are the only one who can do
this for us."



The young boy's heart thudded in his chest, so hard he could barely hear a thing. He had come across men like
him, men whose emotions changed in a split second. Most of the time, their anger was directed towards him. While
being afraid for her, he was also grateful for the woman.



No one who had taken him in had ever asked this task of him. Most of them were people born on the ground. Some
wanted him to do chores, some wanted him to steal for them. There were many who simply wanted someone to beat.
There were others who wanted unspeakable things.



But none of them ever asked for this. After running away from the orphanage and stumbling across this town when
he was just five years old, in his three years of living here, he had never come across someone who had been
banished from the sky.



He pictured that blue paradise again. He pictured himself finally being able to see the sky without the large
pieces of land in the way. He wanted it more than anything.



So the boy nodded, and the man's face turned ecstatic.



The next morning, the man and the boy set out for the stairway on horseback. After riding for hours, the man
explained that he could not get any closer to the stairway, and the boy would have to walk the rest of the way
there. After he figured out what time of the day no guards were present, he was to walk back and report to him.
The top of the stairway could be seen from this distance, and the boy felt in awe. He did not even mind having
to walk.



He walked for as long as he was on the horse. Soon, his feet bled and he could walk no longer, but the bottom of
the stairway came in sight. It was in a grove surrounded by trees, spiraling up to the sky. Two guards were
posted outside, wearing golden armor and carrying silver spears.



The boy hid some distance from them behind a tree. All he could do was wait.



For hours, the guards did not move. Then, another set of guards came to replace the others. The day went by, and
there were always guards by the entrance to the stairway. He felt sleepy, close to collapsing. As the sky turned
dark, the boy grew weary, and he closed his eyes and slept.



The sound of a bird cawing in the distance startled him awake. He opened his eyes and stood up, his heart
hammering. The sun was just beginning to rise. He had been asleep all night.



The boy turned his attention towards the stairway, and he was shocked to see that no one was there.



For someone who had been dreaming of going to the sky his whole life, of course the boy wasn't going to turn
back to report to that man. He took a deep breath and ran to those stairs as fast as he could, nothing in his
mind but climbing to the top.



He climbed the steps faster than he had ever run before, and he didn't care how loud his steps were. The air
rushed in his ears, and it was harder to breathe as he climbed higher and higher.



At last, he reached the top.



The boy looked around. He was in a garden, with ponds of fish and flowers all around. Then he looked up into the
sky, and the pink hue of the rising sun took his breath away. There was no longer any land to block his view of
the clouds. They were so close he could touch them.



"Hey!" a voice shouted, followed by pounding footsteps.



He took off running, and he heard the guard chasing after him. The boy was terrified for his life, but he also
thought that maybe he could die now that he had achieved his dream.



The boy stopped running. He looked into the sky once more, and he felt himself smile.



Suddenly, a hand grabbed his own and pulled him along. It wasn't the guard, but a girl. He couldn't see her face
as they ran. All he could do was run with her, the scent of flowers filling his mind.
