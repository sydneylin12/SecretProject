Walking into her house with a heavy heart, Kisani nearly collapsed against =
the wall. After the exchange with Kona, Kisani felt more confused than ever=
 before.=20

Before Kisani could even form a thought, Kona ran away into the bustling ma=
rket, leaving Kisani in the middle of nothingness, feeling a sudden coldnes=
s in the hand that held Kona's.=20

"Who was that?"=20

A cold voice washed over Kisani, shocking her back into reality.=20

At the kitchen table sat her mother, with eyes so empty it was like looking=
 at a statue. Her face appeared sunken in, and her normally thick brown hai=
r seemed thinner. She looked more ill than the dying patients in the hospit=
al.=20

It had been weeks since Kisani had last seen her mother. How could she have=
 changed so much in such a short time?=20

"It has been a while." Kisani's mother stood, and despite her sickly visage=
, appeared tall and domineering. She held out her arms and gave Kisani a th=
in smile. "Come."=20

Cautiously, Kisani ambled towards her mother on unsteady legs, feeling as i=
f she could topple over at any second. The walk to the kitchen table seemed=
 to last for an eternity as her mother's strange aura loomed closer and clo=
ser.=20

Kisani walked into her mother's arms, trembling at the ice cold embrace.=20

The grip tightened. "Who was that?" Although her mother's voice was gentle,=
 Kisani heard the underlying demand.=20

"A friend," she replied quietly. "Kona."=20

"Speak up, I can barely hear you."=20

Kisani flinched. "A friend," she said louder. "Her name is Kona."=20

"I've never met her before."=20

You haven't met a lot of my friends.

"What were you two discussing?" her mother asked, letting Kisani out of the=
 embrace and staring her dead in the eye. "It looked quite serious."=20

Kisani froze. "We were... just talking."=20

Her mother eyed her suspiciously, scrutinizing Kisani under those coal blac=
k eyes.=20

Ever since her father and brother died, Kisani's mother had become much mor=
e dedicated to her job, especially for capturing people from the sky.=20

"Kisa," her mother said softly, "you know, my hearing has gotten a lot wors=
e."=20

She nodded, a feeling of dread creeping up on her.=20

"I've gotten very good at reading lips."=20

Instinctively, Kisani grabbed her mother's arms. "Mother, please," she begg=
ed, an overwhelming fear taking over.=20

"She's from the sky." Her mother spat out the words like poison. "Do you kn=
ow why people from the sky are sent down here? They were criminals up there=
. She is a criminal."=20

Kisani froze. "What?"=20

Her mother sighed frustratedly. "They send people down here for the worst c=
rimes imaginable. They believe it is a fate worse than death." She grabbed =
Kisani's shoulders and leaned forward, their eyes so close Kisani could see=
 every bit of rage behind them. "Do you understand?"=20

She shook her head, feeling her own breathing rapidly increasing. "Kona's n=
ot a criminal."=20

"Kisani!" her mother snapped. "Stop being naive!"=20

"Kona's not a criminal!" Kisani cried. The weeks they spent together, the m=
oments they shared. All of that could not have been a lie.=20

Her mother scoffed, rolling her eyes. "I've interrogated enough people from=
 the sky to know. Most of them are sent here for murder or assault. These a=
re the most serious of crimes, Kisani. Your father was sent here for attemp=
ted murder, remember?"=20

She wanted to say that Kona would never do either of those things. Kona was=
 kind and sweet and never did anything wrong to Kisani and her other friend=
s. She laughed at their jokes, comforted Kisani when Minnie left, and even =
offered to help cure her illness.=20

"Kona said she had something she needed to do," Kisani insisted. "That's wh=
y she's here. She's not a criminal."=20

Her mother gave her a look that seemed a lot like pity. "She is capable of =
lying, you know."=20

"I believe her," Kisani stated, although her voice wavered.=20

"Of course you do." Her mother sat back down in her chair, sighing exaspera=
tedly. "I believed your father, too. I believed he could save our family. A=
nd look what happened." Gesturing exaggeratedly at their surroundings, she =
said, "Look what happened to our family."

Kisani looked at the kitchen table, remembering her and her brother sitting=
 there side by side, him always picking at his food and her scolding him fo=
r doing so. She saw him hiding her under the table and covering her ears wh=
ile their father beat their mother endlessly. As she cried and trembled and=
 prayed for it to stop, he would hold her hands and would never let go. She=
 glanced at the small room on the other side and saw him lying on the mat, =
face as white as a sheet, telling her to get their mother because he didn't=
 feel well. In her head, she pictured the hospital room where he died in hi=
s bed of the illness their father brought with him to the ground.=20

She also saw her mother, bloody and bruised on the kitchen floor every time=
 she managed to incur his wrath. Her mother began to fade away, no longer e=
ven visiting her brother in the hospital, no longer coming home to see Kisa=
ni.=20

She even thought of herself, dead in a month.=20

"It's all his fault," her mother snarled through gritted teeth. "And that g=
irl is a criminal who will only end up hurting you."=20

"No." Kisani shook her head, stumbling backwards, almost tripping over her =
own feet. "She wanted to help. She wanted to cure me. She... She said she w=
ould take me up there =E2=80=94 "=20

Her mother laughed, and the sound was like something out of a nightmare, ma=
king Kisani's blood curdle. "We are forbidden from going up there, you stup=
id girl." She stood up from her chair, walking towards Kisani, her footstep=
s booming in Kisani's ears. "You would have been killed by guards the momen=
t you even attempted it."=20

"She might have had some way =E2=80=94 "

"Even if the guards down here did not kill you, you would be killed up ther=
e." Her mother moved closer until she was right in front of Kisani, towerin=
g over her menacingly. "Can you not understand?"=20

"But =E2=80=94 !" Kisani's breaths came out harshly. "What reason would she=
 have to kill me?"=20

Sighing, her mother bent down so they could see eye to eye. "Sometimes ther=
e is no reason. Those people up there hate us, and she is one of them."=20

She is one of them.

Kona's face began to twist inside Kisani's mind. All the smiles and laughte=
r, all the tears and memories. Kona's face in all their moments together wa=
rped and morphed into evil grins and insincerity. Shadows radiated from her=
 body, the traces of her malicious heart seeping through the cracks. She be=
gan to look like a monster.=20

"This whole time... she was just trying to kill me?" Kisani whispered, bare=
ly getting her voice to work.=20

It was likely her mother couldn't hear her, but judging from her nod, she h=
ad read Kisani's lips.=20

Staring into nothing, Kisani felt her cheeks dampen as unexpected tears fel=
l.=20

She was never my friend.

Kisani's mother pulled her into another embrace, and Kisani felt all the st=
rength leave her as she cried in her mother's arms.=20

"This is what they do," her mother said sadly. "Their kind has hurt us for =
centuries. Nothing has changed."=20

Kisani grabbed onto her mother tighter, sobbing louder.=20

"My poor girl." She rubbed Kisani's back gently. "I will take care of this =
for you."=20

For the rest of the day, Kisani laid in the bed in her own home, staring at=
 the ceiling, feeling so hollow she thought she might as well die at that m=
oment.
