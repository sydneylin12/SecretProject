The weeks Astero spent in the Fen clan were the happiest he had been in a w=
hile, partly because his mother was so happy, but partly because he had fin=
ally found a way to descend the staircase without alerting anyone.=20

No one knew of his plans. Not even Xen, whom Astero had befriended as the w=
eeks went by. Xen had been kind enough to teach him martial arts, and while=
 Astero was not entirely skilled, he did learn. Other than Xen, he spent a =
lot of time with his uncles and aunties.=20

Astero met his Uncle Zhilin's three month-old daughter, Yin. The first time=
 he held her in his arms, she cried so loudly Astero nearly dropped her. Au=
ntie Lanmi, his uncle's wife, had been kind enough to teach him how to prop=
erly hold a child.=20

He also met Cy Ong, Auntie Anji's fianc=C3=A9e. He was shy and sweet, which=
 contrasted nicely with his auntie's bold personality. They were to be marr=
ied in two years.=20

He learned that his Auntie Meira was engaged to the leader of the Priyavans=
u clan, and they would be getting married later this year. She didn't hate =
the man, but she didn't like him either. He was quite a bit older than her,=
 and he had a reputation for keeping a variety of lovers. Astero's mother h=
ad tried talking to their father to cancel their marriage, and he was willi=
ng to listen, but Auntie Meira insisted on going through with it. She was b=
orn sickly and physically weak, just like their mother who died giving birt=
h to Auntie Anji. Auntie Meira feared no one would want to marry her, until=
 Chansuya Priyavansu expressed his interest. She felt she had to marry him,=
 out of a sense of duty and gratefulness.

His Uncle Luxian had a reputation as a notorious flirt, and he refused to b=
e engaged until he met someone he truly liked. He wanted to stay in the cla=
n as commander of the army, so he wished to marry someone already in the cl=
an.=20

The four of them did not share a mother with Astero's mother. His grandfath=
er, Raigo Fen, married Noemi Sanu, his first wife, who died of illness just=
 a few years after Astero's mother was born. Afterwards, he married Maiya Y=
u, a member of the Fen clan, and had four children together. Unfortunately,=
 she died as well, and Astero's grandfather had not married since.=20

"She treated me well," his mother had said when he asked if Maiya Yu had be=
en spiteful towards her for not being her child. Astero had read many stori=
es of evil stepmothers. However, she assured him that her stepmother was ex=
ceptionally kind towards her. "She always treated me like her own daughter.=
 If she hadn't, I feel as if I would not be as close to them as I am."=20

"Who are you closest to?" he had asked, curious.=20

She thought for a moment before saying, "Probably Zhilin. But I love them a=
ll, of course."=20

"Why Uncle Zhilin?" He thought she would have said Auntie Anji.

His mother sighed. "I was actually supposed to be the heir of the Fen clan =
until your father came. Our marriage was sudden, and Linlin barely had any =
time to prepare to be the clan heir. He was only thirteen years old when I =
left, and he had cried and begged me not to leave, saying he couldn't do it=
, that he needed me. Of course I felt terrible for leaving all of them, but=
 him most of all. He had so much responsibility suddenly thrust upon him." =
Her eyes were sad, but there was also a touch of guilt, something Astero re=
cognized very well. "The Fen and Elessai clans' relationship was still unst=
able, so I was not allowed to communicate with anyone when I married your f=
ather. But when Linlin started secretly sending me letters, asking me for h=
elp on a variety of things and asking me how I was doing, I couldn't bear t=
o ignore him. I couldn't send letters to my other siblings. It would have b=
een too risky. But my little brother needed my help."=20

"So the only person you've been in contact with was Uncle Zhilin?"=20

She nodded. Then, she gave him a stern look. "Don't tell your father."=20

This was the longest Astero had gone without seeing his father. While he di=
d miss him, Astero also felt relieved. He had a feeling his father was quit=
e disappointed with him over a number of things. His lack of talent in anyt=
hing the Elessai specialized in, for one. Their disagreements over his enga=
gement, for another.=20

Astero knew his father loved him and his mother. But it was just... hard. H=
e needed a break, and being in the Fen clan gave him that. He trained in ma=
rtial arts with Xen. His Auntie Anji taught him how to wield a sword. His U=
ncle Luxian helped him train alongside the army. His Auntie Meira was a ski=
lled diplomat, and Astero accompanied her to meetings with other clans. His=
 Uncle Zhilin was skilled in science, and he often showed Astero his experi=
ments. It was how Astero was able to find the formula to make the paralysis=
 needle.=20

He was even able to spend time with his grandfather. Raigo Fen was a stoic =
man who rarely showed emotion on his face. When they first met, Astero knel=
t and bowed along with his mother in front of him.=20

"Rise," he had said, voice slow and deep. The two of them stood, and Astero=
 shifted nervously. "So this is the grandson I've heard about."=20

"Yes, father," replied his mother. "Astero Elessai."=20

"I have heard he is not blood related."=20

Astero stiffened, but his mother simply nodded. "Yes, father."=20

"He looks like a Fen."=20

"So I've been told."=20

"I'm glad he doesn't look like that scoundrel of a husband of yours."=20

Astero looked up in surprise.=20

"Come here, child," he had said, beckoning Astero to come closer.=20

He walked forward on unsteady legs, climbing the stairs of the dais. Raigo =
Fen stood up to face Astero, his face still expressionless, but in his eyes=
, there was a look of fondness. "What would you like for dinner?"=20

Astero was taken aback, having not expected a question like that. "Ah, I'm.=
.. I'm not sure."=20

"Any desserts you like?" he pressed. It seemed almost comical, the way he a=
sked these questions with a stone face.=20

"...Blackberry pie?"=20

His grandfather nodded. He signaled for one of the servants standing toward=
s the side to approach him. "Tell the cooks to make blackberry pie for dess=
ert."=20

"Yes, my lord."=20

"Is there anything else you would like?" Astero's grandfather asked.=20

He smiled, his chest filling with warmth. "Dragonfruit tarts?" They were hi=
s mother's favorite.

Astero heard her laugh behind him.=20

A hint of a smile graced Raigo Fen's features. "Of course."=20

However, he spent the most time with his mother. She took him into town and=
 showed him all her favorite stores and food stalls. She showed him her old=
 room and the places she played as a child. She even took him to her mother=
's grave, and Astero silently thanked his grandmother for giving birth to h=
is mother.=20

The entire family had dinner together most nights. Auntie Anji and Uncle Lu=
xian would argue over who could eat more. Auntie Meira would look at them d=
isgustedly while Cy Ong would gaze fondly at Auntie Anji. Uncle Zhilin woul=
d try to stop them while also feeding little Yin. His wife would simply lau=
gh at their antics. Astero's grandfather would remain expressionless and ea=
t his dinner. And his mother would smile brighter than the sun on a bright =
summer day. Astero's heart warmed at seeing how big his family truly was.=
=20

Saying goodbye to them was more painful than he had anticipated. On the las=
t day of their trip, Astero and his mother stood on the docks, a rowboat wa=
iting to take them into the town where their carriage waited to take them h=
ome. Auntie Anji was crying, and Uncle Zhilin was close to tears. Uncle Lux=
ian was smiling, but his eyes showed deep sadness. Auntie Meira was as expr=
essionless as her father, but it looked as if she was trying not to cry. As=
tero's grandfather wasn't there, as he said he had duties to attend to. His=
 mother said that was likely an excuse. She explained how he couldn't stand=
 goodbyes, as he never even said goodbye to her the day she got married.=20

"We can write to you now, right?" asked his Auntie Anji through sniffles.=
=20

Astero's mother nodded. It looked as if she were holding back tears as well=
.

"And you'll write back?"=20

His mother stepped forward to wrap her arms around her youngest sister, who=
 began to sob uncontrollably.=20

"Of course I will," she reassured.=20

As they cried together, Uncle Zhilin walked up to him and placed a gentle h=
and on his shoulder. "Take care of her."=20

Astero nodded determinedly. Out of everyone in the world, he loved his moth=
er most. And he understood how much her siblings loved her as well. He woul=
d not fail them.=20

"When will you come back?" Auntie Meira asked. "Will Kairo Elessai allow us=
 to visit as well?"=20
=20
"I can talk to him." His mother sighed. "But I think it's father you'd have=
 to convince."=20

"We'll convince him," said Uncle Luxian, resting his elbow on top of Auntie=
 Meira's head. She glanced up at him with an annoyed look, and Astero could=
n't help but laugh.=20

"My lady," said one of the Elessai guards already in a boat that would foll=
ow theirs. "We should leave soon."=20

Auntie Anji burst into sobs again. Uncle Zhilin put a comforting arm around=
 her, but Astero could see his eyes filling with glistening tears.

"Of course," said his mother. Astero stepped into the boat and helped his m=
other in as well. When they were both seated, the boatman began to row, tak=
ing them away from the docks.

Astero saw them waving, and he waved back at them for his mother who faced =
away from them. He tried not to think about the ache in his chest that sudd=
enly appeared the moment the boat set off.=20

Then, near the docks, behind a pillar on one of the pavilions, Astero saw X=
en. He was watching as their boat sailed away, and it would have been a bit=
 bone-chilling if Astero didn't know him. He gave a light wave and wasn't e=
xpecting anything in return. Indeed, all Xen did was slip behind the pillar=
 and disappear.=20

The mood on the journey home was somber. His mother was depressed, and Aste=
ro felt more or less the same. However, he had something to look forward to=
.=20

There was a celebration in the Elessai clan when they arrived home. Astero'=
s father had thrown a feast. The moment they arrived, he wrapped Astero up =
in a hug, and it suddenly occurred to him that he did, in fact, miss his fa=
ther.=20

That evening, Astero informed his parents that he would like to travel for =
a few days, and he insisted on going alone.=20

"Why now?" his mother asked curiously.=20

"I've learned that traveling helps with poetry inspiration," he replied, pu=
tting on a plastic smile.=20

However, they seemed to buy it. Astero's father placed a firm hand on his s=
houlder, and in his eyes, Astero saw pride. "I'm sure you'll come up with s=
omething wonderful."=20

And so that morning, Astero set off for the northern stairway on horseback =
on his own, having reassured his parents he could take care of himself. He =
was, after all, somewhat well-versed in martial arts now. In the Fen clan, =
he was only mediocre, but to the rest of the sky, he would be quite skilled=
.=20

On the way there, he changed out of his purple tunic into a plain brown one=
. It would be safer if no one knew his identity.=20

It was only a days' journey to the Ozario clan, as they were the closest on=
e to Elessai territory. The rumors were indeed true. The marketplace was ne=
arly deserted, and people he did come across looked miserable and hungry. H=
e left his horse in the town stables and continued on foot. It was likely t=
o be stolen, but Astero couldn't seem to care.

When he came upon the manor, the beautiful flowers he had seen there before=
 had all withered and died.=20

This was all his doing. He was the sole reason the Ozario clan fell into ru=
in. Just beyond the manor doors was Lord and Lady Ozario. He could go to th=
em and apologize. But it would be pointless. What he needed to do was find =
her.=20

She was alive. She had to be.=20

Most people in the sky believed that those who were sent to the ground were=
 eaten alive by the barbaric animalistic humans on the ground. They believe=
d they were monsters. No one knew that they were simply human, that Astero =
was one of them.=20

At last, he reached the stairway. Two guards stood by the entrance, and Ast=
ero had to find some way around them. He snuck through the bushes, two para=
lysis needles in hand. Holding his breath and walking as silently as possib=
le, he slowly creeped up to the guards, and as quickly as he could, Astero =
pricked the needles into their necks.=20

He did not stay to find out if it worked. Astero hastily ran for the top of=
 the spiral staircase. He grabbed onto the railing and took a deep breath.

Gazing with feelings of indignation at the large spiral staircase he climbe=
d many years ago, Astero began his descent into the hell he once lived in.
