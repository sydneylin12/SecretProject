<p class="w3-display-middle">
When the Elessai family heard the news that the youngest daughter of the Ozario clan had snuck in a fugitive
from the ground, Kairo Elessai was summoned to Ozario territory for a council meeting on the subject, leaving
his wife, Josemi, to watch over the clan in his place.



Josemi Elessai was a woman of great pride, with values untarnished by anyone else. She originally came from the
Fen clan in the eastern sky, and her marriage to Kairo was to stop a war between their clans. Although she now
belonged to the Elessai clan, she did not let them ruin her ways of life.



For one thing, she was not religious, and so she did not practice their faith. The Elessai worshipped many gods,
and the Fen clan worshipped none. She also continued to train herself in the martial arts of her clan, even
though the Elessai valued the literary arts more.



When she first met Kairo, she was only nineteen years old and was prepared to fight for her right to continue
practicing her clan's culture. However, she was struck at how kind he was to her. He let her do whatever she
wanted, and although they differed in values, they cared for one another and deeply valued family. One thing
they both wanted was a child.



However, after trying for a few years, it was discovered by a physician that Josemi could not bear children.



She put up a brave face to everyone around her. But a child was something Josemi always wanted. Though she had
no children of her own, she was fond of other people's children. She had met the girl, Rosella Ozario, when
Rosella was just a baby. And Josemi could not help but feel that mercy should be given to the young girl,
although she did not think Kairo would feel that way. He detested those from the ground.



Josemi walked outside the manor gates. The Elessai clan manor was a large white castle-like structure. It was
probably the largest among the five clans of the northern sky, certainly bigger than that of the Fen clan. The
Elessai were considered the wealthiest, and they valued commerce and new ideas.



Sometimes she missed the serene pavilion of the Fen clan. Back home, there were ponds of fish and flowers
floating along the water's surface. They rode by boat to get to any neighboring towns. It was a beautiful place,
surrounded by water.



Luckily, just a half hour's walk away from the Elessai clan manor, there was a lake near a forest. Josemi
traveled there whenever she pleased. It reminded her of home.



When she arrived at the lake, Josemi took off her shoes and sat at the lake's edge, wading her feet in the
water. She looked into the water's surface and saw her reflection, a twenty-one year-old woman with long black
hair and narrow dark eyes. Back home, she wore a long headpiece that dangled down into her face, decorated with
jeweled flowers. Now, as a member of the Elessai clan, she wore a simple golden headpiece . It was beautiful,
but sometimes she felt as if she truly didn't belong. With her purple Elessai garments instead of the red of the
Fen clan, it was like looking at a stranger.



Then, another reflection caught her eye, and she startled, looking to her right. There was a young boy gazing
nervously at her. His dark hair, dark eyes, and light skin reminded her of the people of the Fen clan, and she
immediately felt a kinship towards this boy.



"Hello," she said, making her voice as gentle as possible. "What's your name?"



He shook his head.



"You don't have one?"



The boy said nothing.



"Don't be frightened," she assured. "I want to help you. Did you come from the town?"



The boy hesitated a bit before he nodded.



"Are you an orphan?" Josemi asked.



He nodded again.



"Come, sit with me." Josemi patted the space next to her.



The boy looked wary, but after a moment, he walked over and sat by her, hugging his knees to his chest.



"How old are you?" Josemi asked.



"Eight."



"What are you doing out here?"



He shrugged.



"Do you have a place to stay?"



"No."



She finally got a better look at the boy's face, and it looked as if he had been crying.



"You can stay with me," she suggested. "I live over there." Josemi pointed in the direction of the manor, from
which the top could be seen.



He glanced in the direction she pointed in, and his eyes widened. "Woah."



She smiled. "Would you like to live there too?"



"Can I?"



"Of course." Josemi slipped her feet out of the water and dried them on the grass. "You look like you're from
the Fen clan. Are you from the eastern sky?"



The boy looked puzzled. "Eastern sky? But there's only one sky."



Josemi laughed. "I supposed you're right." She put her shoes back on and held out her hand. "Come."



Hesitantly, the boy took her hand. "Can I really stay there?"



She squeezed his hand reassuringly. "Even if my husband says no, I will let you stay."



He gave her a small smile. "Thank you. What should I call you?"



Josemi looked at his face, and it reminded her so much of the people from the Fen clan. She remembered the
children that played in the water. She remembered her younger brothers and sisters running through the manor,
laughing as they chased each other. Josemi was the eldest, so she was always in charge of disciplining them, but
she always loved to see them laugh.



This boy reminded her of home.



"You can call me Mie. It's what people of the Fen clan call an older sister figure." Then she thought for a
moment and hesitated before saying, "Or you can call me mother."



He looked up at her. "Mother?"



She nodded. Perhaps that had been too far for the boy, but before she could worry about it, he smiled widely. To
Josemi, he looked brighter than the sun.



"But what should I call you?" she asked. "Would you like me to name you?"



The boy thought for a moment. Then, he opened the hand that wasn't holding Josemi's, and in his palm, he held
two flowers.



"The purple one is an aster," he explained. "Can I be named after that?"



"Aster?" Josemi thought for a moment. "My husband's name is Kairo. So how about Astero?"



"Astero," he breathed. "I like it!"



Josemi smiled. "I'm glad."



The two walked together hand in hand, and Josemi finally felt like she found a home in the northern sky.
