Crisanto Ozario waited patiently in his guest room at the Dorina clan manor. The walls were sickeningly blue,
with white clouds painted on the ceiling. White quilts covered his large bed, and the blue pillows were arranged
neatly. The wall opposite to the entrance contained two sliding glass doors that led to a balcony overviewing a
forest, a popular hunting ground.



When he first walked into the manor, the first thing he noticed was how lively it was. People milled about,
laughing and talking, excited for the wedding. He hadn't seen such excitement in years.



After becoming clan leader five years ago, the Ozario clan was already in a state of decline. The manor that was
once a beautiful paradise full of flowers and joy turned into a desolate and dreary place. The famous Ozario
clan garden hadn't been tended to in years, leaving all the plants to wither and die. The Dorina clan, with its
lively energy and bustling atmosphere, made him sick to his stomach.



The door to his room quietly opened, and his twin sister sauntered in, her steps light. She shut the door and
strolled past Crisanto to flop onto the bed.



"Lady Elessai agreed," she said cheerfully.



He breathed a sigh of relief. "Perfect."



"Do you think we can find him?" Willow Ozario asked, her eyes staring at the ceiling.



"We have to," Crisanto replied easily. "It shouldn't be too hard."



"The ground is a large place," Willow pointed out.



"You don't think I know that?"



"You are a bit doltish sometimes."



"I'm surprised you know what that means."



Willow sat up, took off one of her shoes, and threw it at him. He smacked it out of the way just in time, and it
thudded on the ground.



Rolling her eyes, Willow simply took off her other shoe and tossed it on the ground. She rolled onto her stomach
and lay face down on the bed. "I hate it here."



"It is very blue."



"You know what I mean." Willow sat up, her face murderous. "They all show up for this ridiculous wedding but
couldn't even be bothered to come to mother and father's funeral."



Crisanto remembered their deaths all too clearly. After all, he had been the one to find them hanging from the
ceiling in their own bedroom.



But before that happened, he had been the one to witness their decline. When Rosella was banished to the ground,
he had been in the western sky, visiting his wife's family for a few months. He hadn't even heard the news until
he arrived home. His little sister was gone, and his parents' minds hadn't recovered. He heard their cries in
the middle of the night. They barely spoke to him during the day. They had grown lifeless and empty, living with
the guilt of not being able to save her.



As the years passed, it only worsened. Once, he and his parents were eating breakfast when his mother started
screaming hysterically. She was staring into the distance at nothing, but she looked as if death was right in
front of her. All the while, his father mindlessly ate, completely ignoring her. Crisanto tried talking to her,
urging her to calm down, but she wouldn't stop screaming. As she was close to passing out, she whispered one
word. Rosella.



Willow had been out traveling during all this. She had refused to marry and wanted to live a carefree life,
exploring all parts of the sky. When she finally came back home, just a few months later, they were dead, and
Crisanto became the new leader.



At first, he resented his sister for being gone all this time. If only she had stayed in the Ozario clan, his
parents could have had at least one child with them. However, he couldn't blame her without blaming himself, for
he too had left them alone. And besides, their parents were dead. Their little sister was most likely dead.
Willow was the only family he had left.



The funeral of Darius and Maeryn Ozario had been small. The clan itself had gone into decline. Many servants
left to work for other clans. The common folk, while understanding at first, grew to resent them for being poor
leaders and leaving them to their own devices. None of the clan leaders showed up.



Kalwen Dorina. Yanni Lem. Safiro Jourman. Kairo Elessai.



Crisanto hated them more than anything.



They were the reason his little sister was sent to the ground. Ruthless people who had no mercy for a young
girl. They were the reason his parents' died. So-called friends who were never there at their worst. They were
the reason the Ozario clan fell into ruin. Crisanto was invited to the wedding more out of courtesy than
anything else. He believed no one actually expected he'd show up. And no one had seen Willow in years. Most
people had forgotten she existed.



That was why their plan would be perfect.



"How long do you think it'll take to find him?" Willow asked.



Crisanto shrugged. "As long as we need. We don't have a deadline."



"I think it should be done on Rosie's birthday." Willow stared out the window, a sad look on her face.



"That gives us a few months." Crisanto could barely remember her face anymore.



A knock sounded at the door, and in walked Anessia, Crisanto's wife. She glanced at the two of them. "Sorry,
were you talking?"



"Not at all, she was just leaving," said Crisanto, easily plastering a smile to his face. Anessia had no idea
what they were planning.



Willow hopped off the bed, strolling to the door with bare feet, bumping Crisanto's shoulder on her way out. "If
you need me, I'll be enjoying the festivities!"



"Your shoes!" he called after her.



"Don't need them!"



He sighed, picking up her thrown shoes and setting them in a corner of the room.



"Is everything alright?" Anessia asked, sitting down at the vanity to remove her jewelry.



"Yes," he replied, laying down in his bed. "Did you have fun in the town?"



"No," she said, removing her silver barrette, letting her blonde hair fall. "That's why I came back early."



Crisanto laughed, looking at her through the mirror. She had been there with him when his parents were decaying.
She had been there when they died. She had been through everything with him.



That was why he couldn't involve her.



Her blue eyes met his. Surrounded by blue in the Dorina clan, her eyes were the only blue he could tolerate.
They were as beautiful as the sky.



"Word is spreading that the Elessai heir is missing," she said, turning around to face him. "The servants were
gossiping. I don't think the townspeople know yet. They're still celebrating."



"We come all this way for a wedding, and now the groom is gone." Crisanto smiled. "Perhaps we should have stayed
home."



"I don't know why you wanted to come anyway." Anessia stood up and walked over to the bed, laying down and
curling up into his side. "I don't think Kalwen Dorina came to our wedding."



He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close. "At least we actually had one."



Anessia laughed, and Crisanto felt that if she kept laughing, she could cure all the pain inside him. "This will
be quite embarrassing for them."



"And it will be a joy to watch."



She tilted her head up, looking into his eyes. "Are you sure everything's all right? Is Willow okay?"



"Why wouldn't she be?"



"How about you?"



He just smiled, planting a kiss on her forehead. "Don't worry about me."



"That's all I ever do."



When all this was over, Crisanto planned to send Anessia back to her family in the west. She had done enough
worrying for him, and he didn't want her to see him turn into a monster.
