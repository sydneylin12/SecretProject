Several days had passed since Astero and Rosella went on their first job together. Since then, he made sure to
accompany her to any job she had, helping her as much as he could. Rosella had insisted on giving him some of
the profits, but he always refused, stating that he simply wanted to help.



The truth was, Astero was more tired than he had ever been in his whole life. Rosella worked every day, usually
from morning until evening. Back home, the servants would prepare his meals, clean his chambers, and wash his
clothes, among many other things. All he had to do was attend his lessons on mathematics, literature, music,
art, history, and politics for the first part of the day, and then he could do whatever he wanted. Since
arriving in the sky, Astero never had to work. That was just another thing he was indebted to Rosella for.



It had actually gotten to the point where, this morning, he had woken up with a fever.



"Oh, you poor thing," cooed Rosella, wiping his forehead with washcloth. "It must have been all the heat and
working out in the sun all day."



Astero just lay there, too tired to speak. His own breath rushed in his ears, and his entire body felt plastered
in place. How pathetic he was to have to be taken care of like a child.



"I'll get you some food," Rosella said softly, standing up to leave.



"I'm sorry," he mumbled, shutting his eyes. He hated how utterly helpless he was.



Rosella laughed lightly. "Sorry again?"



He nodded weakly.



She sighed, placing a cooling hand against his forehead. "Don't push yourself. You're not used to exerting
yourself this much."



Astero only hummed in response.



"I'll be back. Just rest." Then Rosella left the room.



The two of them were supposed to go on another job today. Some rich men from the next town over were visiting to
discuss renovations for the village in the banquet hall, and he and Rosella, along with a few others, were hired
to serve them food and attend to their needs. However, at the moment, Astero could barely attend to his own
needs, much less the needs of others.



He had come down to the ground with the sole purpose of repaying his debt to Rosella. And yet, besides
accompanying her on jobs, Astero had done nothing for her. She was still working as much as ever, still cooking
and cleaning for Jayda, still looking after him during his useless moments. Perhaps his efforts were futile.



Rosella came back in with a bowl of steaming hot soup, and hated himself even more. How dare he trouble her like
this.



"Why do you look so disgusted?" asked Rosella jokingly. "I promise you, Jayda didn't make it."



He shook his head and sighed. "I'm pathetic."



"Have you never gotten sick before?" she asked incredulously.



"Probably, but it never felt this bad."



"Well, when one is sick, it's normal for someone else to take care of them." Rosella kneeled down beside his mat
on the floor and set down the bowl. "So stop worrying, please."



After a few spoonfuls of soup, fed to him like a child by Rosella, Astero felt himself drift in and out of
consciousness.



He woke up groggily, unaware of how much time had passed. Astero looked around the room before realizing Rosella
was no longer by his bedside. He sat up with a start, panic setting in. How long had he slept? Did she really
leave for the job without him? How could he just lay there in bed while she was out working hard and
simultaneously caring for him? He might as well just go back to the sky at that point and marry Melody as
punishment.



The very thought scared him so much he nearly felt sick again. He cursed his own cowardice.



The door slowly opened, and Rosella peeked in. Seeing that he was awake, she exclaimed, "Oh, you look better!"



Astero sighed with relief. "You're here."



"Of course I am." She kneeled by his side and placed the back of her hand against his forehead. "Still a bit
warm," Rosella said, concerned. "Are you comfortable?"



He hesitated. The truth was, his back ached from discomfort. He had been struggling to sleep at night, and
whenever he woke up in the morning, his shoulders and back nearly destroyed him.



Rosella must have seen the hesitation in his features because her expression grew increasingly worried. "You
aren't." Then, her face suddenly lit up, her eyes sparkling. "You can rest in my bed instead!"



That was the last thing he wanted. If he stayed in her bed, she would be the one sleeping on the hard floor, and
Astero would rather sleep on the floor forever than have her suffer this way. He shook his head fiercely. "No,
I'm fine here."



"You're clearly not," she pointed out, unamused. "I'm going out anyway. You need to be in bed all day, so you
might as well stay in mine."



So she was still going to the job without him. He couldn't just tell her not to go. That was how she had been
making a living all these years. Besides, he could barely move at the moment. He was no use to her.



However, he still refused to stay in her bed, insisting that he did not want infect her room. She had just
rolled her eyes but did not argue. After making sure he had enough food and water by his bedside, Rosella left
the house, leaving Astero lying in his bed, feeling worse than ever.



Ever since he visited the Fen clan with his mother when he was just fifteen years old, Astero had been using
their signature paralysis needles to descend the stairway time and time again. He would tell his parents he was
leaving on a trip somewhere, and then he'd go to the ground in search of Rosella. He visited many towns and many
villages, wandering around for years and years. He had stumbled upon places Rosella had actually stayed, where
the people had known her. Most of them said crude things about her, but Astero paid them no mind. His only goal
was to find her, and all his searching had not been futile. A few days before his wedding, Astero had received
information that she was living in a village in the north called Onen, quite a ways away from the northern
stairway, but not too far that he couldn't reach it within a few hours. The day before his wedding, he decided
to set out and find her once and for all. Astero knew it would cause a commotion, but he couldn't find it in
himself to care. And when he found her, all he wanted was to repay her for giving him the life he had dreamed
of.



He had wondered what he would say to her the moment he found her. Astero had been apologizing profusely, and
Rosella found it amusing, but she always believed he apologized for the littlest things. She didn't know what he
had truly done. No amount of apologizing could be enough.



Twenty-three years of living, and most of it was spent in the sky thanks to her. He would probably have
forgotten what life was like on the ground if he hadn't been imagining Rosella experiencing it for fifteen
years. It haunted his dreams, clawing away at his mind. The guilt weighed on his shoulders, constantly reminding
Astero that he was a horrible, horrible person.



For now, all he could do was give her anything he had. But if she asked, and if he could, he would give her the
world.



If anything bad happened to her, he could not help but think that it would be all his fault.
