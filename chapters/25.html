		Kona had genuinely believed her devotion to Lord Ozario and Lady Willow would outweigh her fear of the ground.
		She had been been wrong.



		The moment Kona came into contact with another person, she immediately ran back to the forest that hid the
		staircase, crouching next to a tree to catch her breath. She placed a heavy hand over her heart and tried to
		calm herself, but it did little to ease her panic.



		She chided herself for being so pathetic. Lady Willow and Lord Ozario were depending on her to find Astero
		Elessai. And yet, why wouldn't her hands stop trembling?



		Kona had been trained in the art of stealth and assassination by Lady Willow herself. She had once killed a man
		who tried to take advantage of her by slowly slicing at bits and pieces of his body. Kona was not afraid of
		people in the sky.



		However, those on the ground were a mystery. Like all people living in the sky, she had heard the stories. They
		were monsters, disguised as humans. They would feast on the flesh and bones of each other, and when a sky person
		descended, they would rip them apart. Kona had volunteered for this mission knowing all this, but the moment she
		stepped foot on the ground, fear overwhelmed her. And when she laid eyes on a ground person, she fled like a
		coward.



		The staircase was just beyond the trees. She could use the paralysis needles and ascend back to the sky. She
		could tell Lord Ozario and Lady Willow the truth: that Kona had underestimated how terrifying the ground would
		be.



		Kona groaned, burying her face in her knees as she leaned against a tree, digging her nails into her hands hard
		enough to leave marks. She wanted to scream, but the guards would hear her. She felt like a child, clutching
		onto Lady Willow like her life depended on it.



		They were counting on her. But Kona was so, so scared.



		Ground people were stronger, fiercer, more ruthless. How could she possibly survive?



		Kona took a few more deep breaths. Then, she took out the knife hidden in her shawl and sliced open her forearm,
		blood instantly seeping out of the wound. She hissed, but the pain felt better than the fear. She focused on the
		blood spilling onto the forest floor, watching the dirt and leaves stain red.



		Blood calmed her. It mesmerized her. Its rich, vibrant color, so beautiful and hypnotizing. The smell, metallic
		and sharp, worked like anesthesia on Kona, relaxing her entire body. She wanted to drown in the feeling.



		Kona cut her forearm again right next to the first wound, and the more blood she saw, the calmer she felt. Kona
		wished she could cut open her entire body and let all the blood flow out.



		Focusing on her bleeding forearm, Kona stood, shaking slightly less than before. She put one foot in front of
		the other, steps quiet through the forest. Eyes still on the blood dripping down her arm, Kona walked until she
		made it out of the forest, reaching the hill where the village lay just ahead.



		There were people close to the fence separating the village from the outskirts. They wore commoners' clothing,
		picking flowers from the ground and fruits from trees. Why did they have need for such novel things? What use
		did monsters have for them?



		'Focus on the blood.'



		She cut another slice into her forearm and watched the blood fall. Kona steeled her expression, hardened her
		gaze, tried to look enough like one of them. She focused on the overwhelming smell of blood.



		"E - Excuse me!" Kona called, walking slowly towards them.



		They all turned to look up at her, and she almost recoiled in fear.



		"I - I'm... uh..."



		They looked at each other for a moment, until one person, a small old woman with gray hair and strangely kind
		eyes, stepped forward. "Are you lost?"



		Kona gazed directly at the blood on her arm while replying. "Yes, and I'm looking for someone." Her voice came
		out shaky and quiet.



		"Celeste, she's bleeding," pointed out another woman.



		Instinctively, Kona hid her arm behind her back, afraid the monsters would be attracted to the scent of her
		blood.



		"I can help you," said the old woman, smiling gently. "I'm a doctor."



		Kona reeled back. She had to be lying. Ground people weren't doctors.



		The old woman, sending Kona's skepticism, took a step back. "Please don't be afraid. I've been a doctor for
		years."



		"You're lying!" Kona blurted out, then immediately shut her mouth. She had just offended this monster. It was
		going to attack her at any moment.



		The woman, as well as the rest of the people, glanced worriedly at one another. Kona was rooted to her spot,
		trembling in fear, unable to focus on her bloody arm to keep calm.



		"What makes you think that?" the woman asked slowly.



		Kona did not know what to say. She tried to slow her breathing, but that only rapidly increased it.



		"I'm..." Kona swallowed. "I'm not afraid of you."



		"That's good." The woman smiled, and for a moment, Kona's defenses dropped. "I want you to trust me. Can I take
		a look at your arm?"



		Kona brought up her arm from behind her, red-stained and trembling. She was close to passing out. Three cuts was
		too many, especially with how deep she made them, but Kona was too nervous to cut any shallower.



		The woman took a step towards Kona. "Do you trust me?"



		In all honesty, Kona wanted to. She was close to passing out and would eventually have no choice but to leave
		her life in the hands of these monsters. Kona was usually careful about these cuts, but being on the ground made
		her unsteady, which was shameful for a disciple of Willow Ozario.



		She shook her head. "I..."



		Before she knew it, Kona was falling forward, landing on the ground like a broken statue, feeling her resolve
		shatter into pieces.



		There were shouts all around her, and Kona felt herself being carried in someone's arms. A man was holding her.
		Another monster.



		"I'll treat her in the village," said the old woman, placing a gentle hand on Kona's arm.



		"Let go of me," she mumbled weakly, struggling pointlessly. She could feel her eyes drifting to a close, and
		Kona forced them to remain open and alert.



		"What's your name, dear?" asked the woman as they walked closer to the village.



		Kona did not have the time to answer, for her consciousness had already slipped away.



		When she awoke next, she was lying in a bed, feeling weak and dizzy. She sat up with a start, reaching for the
		knife hidden in her shawl... only to realize the shawl had been taken from her.



		There was no time to panic. Kona needed to find the shawl and slip out of this place unnoticed. She shuffled out
		of bed, lightly pressing her feet against the floor so as not to make a sound, controlling her breathing to be
		as silent as possible.



		Suddenly, footsteps sounded right outside the door, and Kona leaped on the other side of the bed, hiding behind
		the frame. She ceased all breathing as someone stepped inside.



		Kona heard the person sigh. "I brought food for you. You lost a lot of blood, so eat to gain your strength
		back."



		It wasn't until now that Kona realized her arms had been bandaged up.



		"Are you in here?" The voice seemed quieter, more unsure.



		Kona did not move.



		"I don't know why you're scared of us," said the woman, her voice gentle, "but all we want is to take care of
		you. I hope you can believe me."



		Kona did not say a word.



		"My name is Celeste." The bed dipped as the woman took a seat at the edge. Kona gripped the side railing, her
		fingers turning white. "Would you tell me your name?"



		The woman turned around and peered over the bed, right at Kona's crouching form. Kona moved faster than she
		thought possible, as if a rush of wind carried her arms forward, guiding her hands around the woman's neck. She
		pinned her against the bed, but for some reason, Kona couldn't bring herself to squeeze any tighter.



		Those eyes were not the eyes of a monster, as much as Kona tried to deny it. They gazed at her softly and
		sincerely, as if Kona were a small, innocent child. Lady Willow cared for her, but she also pushed her to her
		limits, training Kona, preparing her for the worst. She would be disappointed and angry when Kona did something
		wrong, just like a mother.



		But this woman looked at her as if she could never do any wrong, even though in one second, Kona could squeeze
		the breath out of her.



		It hit her all of a sudden, like a bolt of lightning striking her heart. With shaking hands, Kona pulled herself
		off the old woman, Celeste, and sat back on the bed, breathing heavily.



		Celeste sat up slowly, a sad smile on her face. "I apologize if I startled you."



		Kona shook her head, feeling too ashamed to look at her.



		"You must have been through a lot."



		"What is wrong with you?" Kona demanded.



		Celeste seemed confused. "What do you mean?"



		"I just... I don't understand. Why are you taking care of me?"



		"I'm a doctor," replied Celeste, as if that was explanation enough. "I treat all people. You are a person,
		aren't you?"



		'A person?'



		Perhaps Lady Willow and Lord Ozario made a mistake. Perhaps they had led her down a different set of stairs that
		simply led to another part of the sky. People on the ground weren't actually people.



		But there was a person right in front of Kona.



		"...Thank you, Celeste."



		The old woman's eyes widened with delight. She smiled, and all the tension in Kona dissipated. "Would you like
		some lunch?"



		Kona felt strong enough to walk, and so the two of them headed to the dining hall. They appeared to be in a
		large hospital, and Kona noticed other people with a variety of injuries. What need would the monsters on the
		ground have for treating one another? Unless she had been wrong the entire time, and they weren't monsters. They
		were just like people in the sky.



		Celeste led Kona to a small wooden table, where a few people were already eating. Kona sat at the very end, and
		Celeste remained standing. Immediately, all eyes were on her. Kona noticed that they all seemed to be around her
		age.



		"This is a new patient," introduced Celeste. "Be nice, and don't ask anything personal."



		"Yes, ma'am," replied one of the boys, smiling brightly at her.



		She walked over to his side and pinched his cheek affectionately. Kona felt her heart lurch at the sight, for
		how could monsters care for one another like this? Growing up as an orphan on the streets of the Sanu clan, she
		was often scorned and turned away, treated like a pest. The Sanu valued strength and did not take too kindly to
		weaklings. Kona did not know what it meant to care for someone until she met Lady Willow. How could it be
		possible that the people of the Sanu seemed more like monsters than the people on the ground?



		"So where you from?" asked one of the boys, his eyes wide and curious.



		One of the girls slapped his arm. "Celeste said to not ask anything personal."



		"That's not personal!" he protested.



		"Ignore him," said the girl, smiling at Kona. Her skin was dark like the people of the Jourman clan, with black
		hair and dark brown eyes. But her smile reminded Kona of Zonem, who was the sweetest person she knew.



		"Kisani!" the boy whined.



		"I'm Kisani," she said, continuing to ignore him. "And this is Damien, Minnie, and Lawrence. You don't have to
		tell us your name if you don't want to."



		"I'm Kona," Kona replied quietly. It wasn't her real name, anyway. She did not know her real name.



		"You here for arm injuries?" asked Lawrence, the boy who had his cheeks pinched by Celeste.



		Kona looked down at her arms that were wrapped in bandages. Celeste must have treated her. Kona was becoming
		more convinced that the staircase simply led to another part of the sky. There was no way people on the ground
		could be this kind.



		And so, Kona felt more comfortable. She smiled along with their jokes, and even learned she was the same age as
		Kisani. Damien and Kisani would constantly bicker, Lawrence would joke around with everyone, and Minnie, a
		fourteen year old girl who looked like she was a member of the Priyavansu clan, sat quietly, but she seemed to
		be enjoying herself nonetheless.



		Kona never had many friends. She spent most of her days with Lady Willow, training in the art of assassination.
		The only person she met her age recently was Melody Dorina, and that did not turn out well.



		She felt safe here.



		"Kona, let's get more food!" suggested Lawrence, already standing up.



		The once renowned and feared assassin of the Sanu clan smiled and hurriedly followed after him.
