		As Kona walked through the town, where festivities were still in order for the wedding that was supposed to
		happen today, she almost felt bad at seeing all the happy people. No one outside of the main families of the
		five clans knew Astero Elessai was missing.



		Kona had been the one to see him escape down the northern stairway. The way he did it — pricking the guards with
		a paralysis needle from the Fen clan — suggested he had done this before. It would cause no suspicion, as the
		guards would be standing there the entire time, and once the effects wore off, they wouldn't even know they had
		been paralyzed.



		When she reported the news to Lord Ozario, it was the first time she had seen him laugh out loud. He said that
		Astero Elessai had actually done this before, sneaking into Ozario territory, paralyzing the guards, and
		climbing down the stairway. Lord Ozario never sent anyone to follow him, as he did not care much for what the
		Elessai heir was up to, and he would always be back within the day. However, to climb down again the day before
		his wedding, Lord Ozario wanted to see if Astero Elessai would be back before the day's end, and alas, he was
		not. He was ecstatic to use this information to acquire the help of Josemi Elessai.



		Today would be the day Kona set foot on the ground. Her task was to find Astero Elessai and keep track of him
		until the time came to bring him back to the sky.



		It was much too crowded in the town, and much too bright. Kona pulled her black hood over her head, trying to
		remain inconspicuous.



		Children ran around the streets, chasing one another and laughing. She looked up and saw an old, decrepit wooden
		building, where an old woman stood, smiling as she watched over the children.



		This must have been an orphanage, and it actually looked far better than the one Kona had grown up in, far to
		the west in Sanu clan territory. The Sanu clan had a reputation for spending a minuscule amount of their money
		on the welfare of their people, despite having so much of it. Kona owed a debt to Lady Willow for rescuing her
		from that place and taking her to live in the Ozario clan. The only reason she volunteered to be sent to the
		ground was to help Lady Willow and Lord Ozario get their revenge. She did not hate the other clans as they did,
		and she did not do it for money. Kona simply wanted to repay their kindness.



		Suddenly, Kona heard a thud, followed by a yelp from a high-pitched voice. She turned and saw that a child had
		bumped into a rich-looking woman, who looked to be around the same age as Kona. The child had fallen to the
		ground and was staring up at the woman in fear. She just glared at him.



		"Watch it, brat," she snapped.



		The nanny of the orphanage quickly hobbled over. She did not help the child up, and instead, bowed her head to
		the woman. "My lady, my most sincere apologies."



		The woman scoffed. "It will take more than that."



		"Of course, anything you'd like!" The old nanny's voice was shaky, and Kona saw her hands trembling.



		"This child must be punished," declared the woman. "That seems fair, doesn't it?"



		The two maidservants by her side quickly nodded along, agreeing with her.



		The little boy on the ground instantly burst into tears, his entire body shaking from the racking sobs. However,
		the woman showed no compassion.



		"What do you think your punishment should be, hm?" she asked mockingly.



		Kona felt her blood boil, and she clenched her fists in rage. She needed to remain inconspicuous, but this woman
		was too cruel for Kona to just sit back and watch. Kona had been just like him, an orphan pushed around by
		people with power.



		Steeling herself, Kona walked over there with her head held high. She was stronger now. She did not fear people
		like her. Not anymore.



		Kona crouched down and held the boy in her arms. "Are you all right?" she asked.



		He gazed at her with teary eyes, lips trembling.



		"Excuse me," interjected the woman, sounding annoyed. "Who are you?"



		Kona looked up at her. The woman was beautiful, with long brown hair and stormy gray eyes. The sharp angles of
		her face gave her an intimidating aura. The dark blue dress she wore looked expensive and intricately crafted,
		giving Kona the impression that this woman was powerful indeed.



		She stood up and faced her. Kona was shorter, and she cursed her unfortunate genes. "Kona," she answered. "And
		you?"



		The woman raised her eyebrows in surprise. "You don't know me?"



		"Apologies, I'm not from here. I came for the wedding."



		Strangely enough, at the mention of the wedding, the woman's expression cracked every so slightly. "Ah," she
		said, laughing awkwardly, "of course. The wedding."



		"...yes, the wedding."



		The woman composed herself and regained her ice-cold expression. "It doesn't matter. Out of the way. The boy
		must be punished."



		"For what, exactly?"



		"Injuring me."



		Kona scanned the clearly unhurt woman. "Injured where?"



		"Does it matter?" she snapped. "The point is, he almost did. Isn't that enough?"



		Kona was flabbergasted. "Are you serious?"



		"Why wouldn't I be?" replied the woman, equally taken aback. "If I actually had gotten hurt, he would be sent to
		the ground."



		"It was an accident. Are you always this heartless?"



		A flash of rage appeared on the woman's face, and Kona thought for a moment, she would have to physically defend
		herself. However, the old nanny intercepted. "My lady, please have mercy," she begged, putting her hands
		together to show sincerity. "The boy will be disciplined, I assure you."



		The woman thought for a moment before saying, "Very well then. Since today is a special day, I will show mercy
		just this once."



		"Thank you," cried the old nanny. "I wish you everlasting happiness in your marriage, my lady."



		The woman smiled tersely and did not reply.



		The old nanny bent down and ushered the boy to his feet, and the two of them hurried inside the orphanage before
		any more harm could be done, leaving Kona with the woman who she now realized was Melody Dorina.



		"Well?" She made a 'shoo' gesture with her hand. "Scram."



		Kona scowled, but she did step out of Melody Dorina's way. As she and her maidservants walked past, Kona
		couldn't resist muttering, "I see why the groom ran away."



		Melody Dorina whirled around so fast, Kona nearly got dizzy herself. "Excuse me?"



		Kona knew she shouldn't have drawn attention to herself, but the fearful eyes of the little boy — eyes that
		reminded her so much of herself — kept haunting her mind.



		"You heard me," she replied, making herself appear fearless and unmovable.



		Melody Dorina's eyes narrowed. "Are you trying to prove something? Because this is pointless."



		It most likely was. What was Kona trying to accomplish by angering Young Lady Dorina? She undoubtedly did not
		regret scaring the poor boy, and Kona knew nothing she said would change her attitude. Dejected, Kona bowed her
		head and did not say a word.



		However, Melody Dorina slowly walked closer to her with a scrutinizing gaze. She hissed, "How did you know?"



		Her striking gray eyes caught Kona off guard, and she almost didn't hear what Melody Dorina said. "Know what?"



		"That Astero is gone!"



		Right. No one outside the main families of the clans were supposed to know. Kona scolded herself for being
		careless, and she replied, "There are rumors, that's all."



		Melody Dorina glared. "People have been talking behind my back?"



		"You cannot stop the people from gossiping, Young Lady Dorina."



		Kona heard her take in a huge breath, as if she were trying to calm herself down. Her hands were clenched into
		fists at her sides. "Let me tell you something," she said, her voice quiet and deadly. "Astero was kidnapped by
		the south. If I hear someone say he ran away, I will have them punished. Understood?"



		"But what if that's the truth?"



		"It's not!" she cried, baring pearly white teeth against red lips. "He wouldn't do that!"



		"If you say so," replied Kona, shrugging.



		Melody Dorina gazed at her suspiciously. "What was your name again?"



		"Kona."



		"What clan are you from?"



		"Ozario."



		"I will speak with your leader. I want you punished immediately."



		"What for?"



		"Suggesting that my own husband ran away from me!"



		"He's not your husband." Kona smiled slightly, making her own expression one of pity. "I don't think he wants to
		be."



		"How dare you!" she shrieked, stepping closer to Kona, so close she could feel Melody Dorina's breath on her
		cheeks. "Who are you to assume what Astero wants?"



		Kona, feeling satisfied that she managed to get under the other girl's skin, said, "I just know that if I were
		engaged to you, I'd rather go to the ground."



		"That can be arranged," said Melody Dorina through gritted teeth.



		"Oh, there you are!" exclaimed a cheerful voice.



		Both Kona and Melody Dorina turned to see Lady Willow sauntering up to them, smiling brightly. Her sundress was
		bright pink, with clear jewels that twinkled in the sunlight. She looked amused.



		Lady Willow stood beside Kona and bowed her head in acknowledgement to Melody Dorina. "Young Lady Dorina, a
		pleasure."



		Melody Dorina looked annoyed. "I'm sorry, who are you?"



		"Kona's guardian," she replied easily. "I apologize for any issues she has caused."



		"She insulted me!"



		"She is young," said Lady Willow, smiling insincerely. "I trust you will not let such insults get to you, as
		merciful and mature as you are."



		Melody Dorina's face turned red, either with embarrassment or anger, Kona didn't know.



		"I'm afraid we must take our leave." Lady Willow took a hold of Kona's wrist and quickly left Melody Dorina
		standing there with her two maidservants, looking stunned.



		"I'm barely younger than her," muttered Kona.



		"And equally immature," replied Lady Willow, rolling her eyes. "You're the last one we're waiting on, you know."



		"I'm sorry, Lady Willow." Kona didn't mean to cause her trouble.



		Lady Willow sighed. "What's done is done." She glanced at Kona with worry. "I just hope you're ready."



		Kona nodded with determination. "I won't fail you, nor Lord Ozario."



		"Be careful." Lady Willow stopped walking and took Kona into her arms, embracing her tightly. "I don't want to
		lose another little sister."



		All Kona knew of Rosella Ozario was that she was cruelly sent to the ground fifteen years ago. She did not know
		why, as Lord Ozario and Lady Willow never spoke of it around her. Kona hugged her back, almost tearing up at the
		fact that Lady Willow was now shorter than her.



		"I will be careful," Kona replied. She would do everything in her power to find Astero Elessai. And she would do
		everything in her power to bring down the other clans. Lady Willow thought of her as a little sister, but to
		Kona, she was more like a mother. And she would protect her mother no matter what.



		"Good." Lady Willow pulled away, eyes shining with tears. "Let us meet with the others."
