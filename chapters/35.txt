The moment Rosella walked away, Astero wanted to disappear into thin air. T=
he last thing he ever wanted to do in this world was make Rosella upset. An=
d yet, he did exactly that.=20

Still, he prodded for answers, and he got them. Astero only had himself to =
blame. Now he knew that a part of Rosella regretted helping him, and she wa=
s just too kind to admit it.=20

He sighed, resting his head on his hand. Perhaps he should just go back to =
the sky and stop making her life miserable. Even she were on the ground, sh=
e would be away from him. And he would be up there, married to Melody, heir=
 of the Elessai clan, continuing to live a life of lies and deceit.=20

Yet, that still wouldn't be fair. He had a mother and father, a fianc=C3=A9=
e, aunts and uncles, cousins, a grandfather, friends. He never had to worry=
 about finances or working. He never worried whether or not he'd be able to=
 eat the next day.=20

Astero did not belong up there. He could not exist in the sky without her.=
=20

He scolded himself for even thinking of going back. There was promise etche=
d into his heart. A promise to be with the person who saved his life, no ma=
tter what she was going through, no matter if she hated him. He would repay=
 her with everything he had, even if she despised him.=20

Of course Rosella would regret helping him. A thoughtless, idiotic little b=
oy who selfishly climbed the stairway. That day fifteen years ago was the d=
ay Astero should have died.=20

Rosella was the one who gave him a second chance at life. Even if she regre=
tted it, he could not waste this opportunity to provide for her in the way =
she did for him.=20

When Astero reached the top of that stairwell, he had been fully prepared t=
o die. Despite just being a clueless child on the ground, even he knew what=
 he had done was forbidden. Guards were chasing after him, large spears in =
hand. He had gazed at the sky, at the sunrise that took his breath away, an=
d accepted his fate.=20

But at that moment, a gentle hand took his, and his fate changed.=20

His name, his purpose in life, even the poetry he wrote back home... it was=
 all for her. Poetry was the only thing Astero was decent at in the Elessai=
 clan. All it required were strong feelings of a certain kind, and that cam=
e easily to Astero.=20

Feelings of guilt. Feelings of regret. Feelings of self-hatred. Feeling tha=
t he did not belong. Feeling that he took advantage of a kind person. Feeli=
ng that he had been lying to everyone around him his whole life.=20

Everyone he loved only loved him because of his lies. His mother only took =
him in because she believed him to be a runaway orphan from the Fen clan. H=
is mother's side of the family cared for him, but if they knew he was from =
the ground, they would arrest him in a heartbeat. Xen, his only true friend=
, did not know, so Astero hesitated to call him a true friend. Even his fat=
her only seemed to tolerate him nowadays without knowing his origin.=20

He wondered, when Rosella was living up in the sky, what she had thought of=
 people on the ground. She had to have seen the guards coming after him tha=
t day. Yet, she decided to help him anyway.=20

That day was ingrained into Astero's memory like a claw that kept holding h=
im down. Whenever he felt an inkling of happiness, a shred of liberation or=
 worthiness, his crime would pop into his head, and it would all wash away.=
=20

Many times, Astero genuinely wanted to die.=20

About eight years after that fateful day, after four failed attempts at fin=
ding Rosella on the ground, Astero heard news that a noble from a western c=
lan had been sent to the ground. Sending criminals to the ground was a rare=
 occurrence, and news of it spread throughout the whole sky. It shook Aster=
o to his bones, and he had locked himself in his room the whole day. Out of=
 everyone in the sky, he was the worst criminal of all. He wanted to travel=
 to the edge of the sky, to throw himself to the ground and die from the im=
pact. But the rocky terrain and stormy mountains made it nearly impossible =
to reach the edge without dying. Like a coward, Astero did not pursue this =
death.=20

Ten years after that fateful day, Darius and Maeryn Ozario passed away. And=
, having witnessed no one from his clan =E2=80=94 nor any northern clan =E2=
=80=94 planning to attend their funeral, Astero made an effort to sneak out=
 himself. He had just come back from a "poetry inspiration excursion" to th=
e ground, so he could not use that excuse. However, guards brought him back=
 to the manor, and his father scolded him for attempting to attend the fune=
ral. When he asked his father what was so wrong with attending, he said tha=
t the Ozarios have done nothing for the north lately, and they did not dese=
rve the north's grief.=20

After finding out how they died, that night, Astero tried to hang himself t=
he same way. Before the deed could be done, he stopped. And he realized tha=
t death was an easier fate than what he put Rosella through. Than what he p=
ut the entire Ozario clan through.=20

He imagined the ghosts of the late Lord and Lady Ozario watching him, and t=
he claw held him down more painfully. He had never seen them in person, so =
their faceless ghosts haunted his dreams, whispering Rosella's name.=20

Astero also often dreamt of Rosella pushing him off the edge of the sky. Th=
ose were the best dreams he had.=20

Looking to the sky, the sunlight began to dim slightly. He wondered how muc=
h time had passed since Rosella left. Astero gazed at the trees she had dis=
appeared into. That forest led to nowhere, and suddenly, he feared for her =
safety. What if she had been attacked? What if she were lost?=20

Astero stood up quickly and sprinted for the trees, leaving all their food =
behind. If anything happened to her... He could not even bear the thought. =
His pace accelerated, not a rational thought going through his mind. All As=
tero could think about was finding her.=20

When he reached the forest, a flash of white came hurtling towards him. It =
crashed into his chest and fell to the ground with a thud.=20

The person dressed in white looked up at him, and Astero breathed a sigh of=
 relief.=20

"Oh thank the gods," he groaned, nearly collapsing to the ground next to he=
r, closing his eyes in exasperation.=20

"Why were you running?" Rosella demanded, fussing over her white dress that=
 now donned stains from the soil.=20

"Are you all right?" he asked, boosting himself into a standing position. H=
e held out a hand to her.=20

Rosella stared at his hand for a moment, and Astero's heart nearly stopped =
in fear that she truly hated him now, so much that she would not even touch=
 him.=20

Her eyes cast down to the forest floor. She looked smaller than ever. "I'm =
sorry."=20

Astero was taken aback. "For what?"=20

"I snapped at you and ran off like a child."=20

Immediately, Astero knelt down beside her. Taking her hands into his own, h=
e felt the rough calluses on her fingers, the dry skin from hours of workin=
g. He held them gently, as if they were as delicate as a flower petal. "You=
 could never do me any wrong, Rosella."=20

"Of course I can," she stressed, looking exasperated.=20

He shook his head. Of course, she did not understand. "I'm the one who shou=
ld apologize. I brought up bad memories for you."=20

Rosella shrugged. "There is nothing I can do about it now, even if I wanted=
 to."=20

The two were silent for a moment. A question burned in Astero's throat, and=
 although he dreaded hearing the answer, at the same time, he desperately w=
ant to. "If you could see that boy again, what would you do?"=20

"What do you mean?"=20

"Would you be upset with him?"=20

"Astero, I don't know." Rosella pushed herself up to stand. Dusting off her=
 now stained dress, she glanced down at him, still crouched on the forest f=
loor. "It was so long ago. I don't remember what he looked like. I don't re=
member his name."=20

There was no name to remember.

"I barely remember my own family's faces, let alone some child I knew for a=
 day."=20

Two days.

"It doesn't matter, anyway. I'm here now. The past is the past." She gave h=
im a soft smile. "Besides, I would not have met you had I not been sent to =
the ground." Rosella grabbed his arms and hoisted him up. Looking into his =
eyes, she said sincerely, "If everything I had been through led me to you, =
it must be worth it."=20

Astero quickly looked away and hastily wiped the tears that threatened to f=
all. "Let's head back."=20

Rosella nodded. "I am still hungry."=20

The two of them walked back to their picnic blanket, the sky already darken=
ing. They finished all the food, talked until the stars came out, and even =
then, they did not go back to the inn until much, much later. Rosella told =
him about her life in the sky, how she used to be part of the Ozario family=
. She had lived in the Ozario manor which had the biggest, most beautiful g=
arden in all the sky. Astero asked her questions and acted surprised, as if=
 he hadn't already known all these things.=20

He told her how much fun it must have been up there, how lovely it would be=
 to see the sky so clearly. He did not tell her what he was really thinking=
.=20

You would have been so much happier had you never met me.

lked back to their picnic blanket, the sky already darkening. They finished=
